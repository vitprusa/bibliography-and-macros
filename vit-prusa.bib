		  caused by the temperature gradient appearing between the

		  necessary to have an accurate knowledge of the heat

		  estimation of the residual stresses. Since glass is a
		  semitransparent material, radiative heat transfer takes
		  place inside the glass in addition to the conductive heat
		  transfer. In this paper, we implemented 1-D
		  thermomechanical models using different methods for the
		  computation of the radiative effects inside the glass:
		  Rosseland approximation, P1 approximation and back ray
		  tracing. Thermal and residual stresses results are compared
		  to experimental results available in the literature to
		  investigate the effects of the different methods on the
		  heat transfer and mechanical behavior. We found that P1
		  approximation and back ray tracing are in good agreement
		  with the experimental results. Finally, a numerical
		  investigation is done by changing different parameters for
		  which the experimental results are not available.},

  abstract	= { In this paper, we provide a possible methodology for
		  identifying the initiation of damage in a class of
		  polymeric solids. Unlike most approaches to damage that
		  introduce a damage parameter, which might be a scalar,
		  vector or tensor, that depends on the stress or strain
		  (that requires knowledge of an appropriate reference
		  configuration in which the body was stress free and/or
		  without any strain), we exploit knowledge of the fact that
		  damage is invariably a consequence of the inhomogeneity of
		  the body that makes the body locally ‘weak’ and the
		  fact that the material properties of a body invariably
		  depend on the density, among other variables that can be
		  defined in the current configuration, of the body. This
		  allows us to use density, for a class of polymeric
		  materials, as a means to identify incipient damage in the
		  body. The calculations that are carried out for the biaxial
		  stretch of an inhomogeneous multi-network polymeric solid
		  bears out the appropriateness of the thesis that the
		  density of the body can be used to forecast the occurrence
		  of damage, with the predictions of the theory agreeing well
		  with experimental results. The study also suggests a
		  meaningful damage criterion for the class of bodies being
		  considered. }

		  Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A: Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 472, 20160231.
		  (doi:10.1098/rspa.2016.0231)). In a departure from studies
		  on damage that consider the body to be homogeneous, with
		  initiation of damage being decided by parameters that are
		  based on a quantity such as the strain, that requires
		  information concerning a special reference configuration,
		  or the use of ad hoc parameters that have no physically
		  meaningful origins, in this study we use a physically
		  relevant parameter that is completely determined in the
		  current deformed state of the body to predict the
		  initiation of damage. Damage is initiated due to the
		  inhomogeneity of the body wherein certain regions in the
		  body are unable to withstand the stresses, strains, etc.
		  The specific inhomogeneity that is considered is the
		  variation of the density in the body. We consider damage
		  within the context of the deformation of two representative
		  viscoelastic solids, a generalization of a model proposed
		  by Gent (1996 Rubber Chemistry and Technology 69, 59–61.
		  (doi:10.5254/1.3538357)) for polymeric solids and a
		  generalization of the Kelvin–Voigt model. We find that
		  the criterion leads to results that are in keeping with the
		  experiments of Gent \&amp; Lindley (1959 Proc. R. Soc.

		  history is introduced. Furthermore, a continuum-mechanical

		  a general class of coupled bead–spring chain models that
		  arise from the kinetic theory of dilute solutions of
		  nonhomogeneous polymeric liquids with noninteracting
		  polymer chains, with finitely extensible nonlinear elastic
		  (FENE) spring potentials. The class of models under
		  consideration involves the unsteady incompressible
		  Navier–Stokes equations with variable density and
		  density-dependent dynamic viscosity in a bounded domain in
		  Rd, d=2 or 3, for the density, the velocity and the
		  pressure of the fluid, with an elastic extra-stress tensor
		  appearing on the right-hand side in the momentum equation.
		  The extra-stress tensor stems from the random movement of
		  the polymer chains and is defined by the Kramers expression
		  through the associated probability density function that
		  satisfies a Fokker–Planck-type parabolic equation, a
		  crucial feature of which is the presence of a
		  centre-of-mass diffusion term and a nonlinear
		  density-dependent drag coefficient. We require no
		  structural assumptions on the drag term in the
		  Fokker–Planck equation; in particular, the drag term need
		  not be corotational. With initial density
		  ρ0∈[ρmin,ρmax] for the continuity equation, where
		  ρmin>0; a square-integrable and divergence-free initial
		  velocity datum u˜0 for the Navier–Stokes equation; and a
		  nonnegative initial probability density function ψ0 for
		  the Fokker–Planck equation, which has finite relative
		  entropy with respect to the Maxwellian M associated with
		  the spring potential in the model, we prove, via a limiting
		  procedure on certain regularization parameters, the
		  existence of a global-in-time weak solution
		  t↦(ρ(t),u˜(t),ψ(t)) to the coupled
		  Navier–Stokes–Fokker–Planck system, satisfying the
		  initial condition (ρ(0),u˜(0),ψ(0))=(ρ0,u˜0,ψ0), such
		  that t↦ρ(t)∈[ρmin,ρmax], t↦u˜(t) belongs to the
		  classical Leray space and t↦ψ(t) has bounded relative
		  entropy with respect to M and t↦ψ(t)/M has integrable
		  Fisher information (w.r.t. the Gibbs measure
		  dν:=M(q˜)dq˜dx˜) over any time interval [0,T], T>0."

		  methods are used to solve the resulting system. Neutral
		  curves for an extensive range of plate separations are
		  obtained, and, when the plate separation is large compared
		  to the Stokes layer thickness, the linear stability
		  properties of the Stokes layer in a semi-infinite fluid are
		  recovered. A detailed analysis of the damping rates of
		  disturbances to the basic flow provides a plausible
		  explanation of why several previous studies of the problem
		  have failed to detect any linear instability of the flow.
		  
		  To compare more faithfully with experimental work, the
		  techniques used for the channel problem are modified to
		  allow the determination of neutral curves for axisymmetric
		  disturbances to purely oscillatory flow in a circular pipe.
		  Critical Reynolds numbers for the pipe flow tend to be
		  smaller than their counterparts for the channel case, but
		  the smallest critical value is still almost twice the
		  experimentally reported result.}",

  abstract	= "Thermodynamical considerations have largely been avoided
		  in the modelling of complex fluids by invoking the
		  assumption of incompressibility. This approximation allows
		  pressure to be defined as a Lagrange multiplier, and
		  therefore its natural connection with other thermodynamic
		  variables such as density and temperature is irretrievably
		  lost. Relaxing this condition to allow more realistic
		  modelling involves much more than prescribing an equation
		  of state. Even for a simple isothermal viscoelastic model,
		  as explored in this paper, the transition to a compressible
		  model is non-trivial. This paper shows that pressure enters
		  the governing equations in a non-intuitive way.
		  Furthermore, a fluid volume element, which is no longer
		  constant, radically changes the way the basic element of
		  the constitutive equations is viewed---stress is no longer
		  the fundamental constitutive link between the momentum
		  equations and velocity. The importance of geometry in fluid
		  modelling is emphasised through the use of the Lie
		  derivative, which is of a more fundamental character than
		  the ``upper'' and ``lower'' convected derivatives prevalent
		  in the literature and which are found to be almost
		  redundant for a compressible fluid. There is now a strong
		  body of non-equilibrium thermodynamics theory for flowing
		  systems, which proves indispensible for this development.
		  These fundamental principles are described herein using
		  methodology and examples, that are sometimes conflicting,
		  from the literature. The main conflict arises from the
		  relationship between thermodynamic pressure and the trace
		  of Cauchy stress, where the current preferred choice is (up
		  to a constant) to set them equal---this is shown to be
		  incorrect. Other issues such as the dependence of viscosity
		  on density, bulk viscosity, integral modelling, the
		  principle of objectivity and convected derivatives, are
		  also clarified and resolved.",

		  diffuse interface methods, system evolution is driven by
		  the minimisation of a free energy. The originality of our
		  approach, derived from the Cahn--Hilliard model, comes from
		  the particular form of energy we proposed in Boyer and
		  Lapuerta (M2AN Math Model Numer Anal, 40:653--987,2006),
		  which, among other interesting properties, ensures
		  consistency with the two-phase model. The modelling of
		  three-phase flows is further completed by coupling the
		  Cahn--Hilliard system and the Navier--Stokes equations
		  where surface tensions are taken into account through
		  volume capillary forces. These equations are discretized in
		  time and space paying attention to the fact that most of
		  the main properties of the original model (volume
		  conservation and energy estimate) have to be maintained at
		  the discrete level. An adaptive refinement method is
		  finally used to obtain an accurate resolution of very thin
		  moving internal layers, while limiting the total number of
		  cells in the grids all along the simulation. Different
		  numerical results are given, from the validation case of
		  the lens spreading between two phases (contact angles and
		  pressure jumps), to the study of mass transfer through a
		  liquid/liquid interface crossed by a single rising gas
		  bubble. The numerical applications are performed with large

		  are not constant but increase with increasing minor
		  principal stress. The use of classical constant modulus
		  linear elasticity in these cases can lead to erroneous
		  predictions of the deformations and of the initiation and
		  extent of failure around underground excavations. To
		  illustrate these effects, solutions are developed for
		  axisymmetric excavations in infinite media having power law
		  and exponential variations of elastic modulus with minor
		  principal stress. The maximum stress concentrations do not
		  occur at the excavation boundaries and are less than the
		  constant value of 2.0 given by constant modulus elasticity.
		  When modified slightly to allow for test boundary
		  conditions, the theory gives predictions that are
		  consistent with aspects of the results obtained in
		  hydrostatic compression tests on thick walled cylinders of
		  three sedimentary rocks.",

		  construction of physically motivated Lyapunov functionals
		  for nonlinear stability analysis of spatially homogeneous
		  equilibrium states in thermodynamically isolated systems.
		  Unfortunately, the limitation to isolated systems is
		  essential, and standard arguments are not applicable even
		  for some very simple thermodynamically open systems. On the
		  other hand, the nonlinear stability of thermodynamically
		  open systems is usually investigated using the so-called
		  energy method. The mathematical quantity that is referred
		  to as the &ldquo;energy&rdquo; is, however, in most cases
		  not linked to the energy in the physical sense of the word.
		  Consequently, it would seem that genuine thermo-dynamical
		  concepts are of no use in the nonlinear stability analysis
		  of thermodynamically open systems. We show that this is not
		  the case. In particular, we propose a construction that in
		  the case of a simple heat conduction problem leads to a
		  physically well-motivated Lyapunov type functional, which
		  effectively replaces the artificial Lyapunov functional
		  used in the standard energy method. The proposed
		  construction seems to be general enough to be applied in
		  complex thermomechanical settings.},

		  a structure for the Gibbs potential based on the Cauchy
		  stress. We study the tension/compression of a cylinder,
		  biaxial stretching of a thin plate and simple shear within
		  the context of our constitutive relation. We then compare
		  the predictions of the constitutive relation that we
		  develop and that of Ogden’s constitutive relation with
		  the experiments of Treloar concerning tension/compression
		  of a cylinder, and we show that the predictions of our
		  constitutive relation provide a better description than
		  Ogden’s model, with fewer material moduli. }

		  appropriate jump conditions are established by using the
		  calculus of distributions, taking into account the
		  curvature of the interface as well as the density and

		  tension, a dynamic surface tension appears and turns out to
		  be proportional to the mass transfer across the interface
		  and to a coefficient related to the variations of density
		  and viscosity within the interface. Explicit solutions are
		  exhibited to illustrate the importance of these new jump
		  conditions. The example of the Earth's inner core
		  crystallisation is questioned.}

		  method of constitutive parameters is developed from full
		  kinematic and thermal field measurements. It consists in
		  reconstructing the heat source field from two different
		  approaches by using the heat diffusion equation. The first
		  one requires the temperature field measurement and the
		  value of the thermophysical parameters. The second one is
		  based on the kinematic field measurement and the choice of
		  a thermo-hyperelastic model that contains the parameters to
		  be identified. The identification is carried out at the
		  local scale, ie, at any point of the heat source field,
		  without using the boundary conditions. In the present work,
		  the method is applied to the challenging case of
		  hyperelasticity from a heterogeneous test. Due to large
		  deformations undergone by the rubber specimen tested, a
		  motion compensation technique is developed to plot the
		  kinematic and the thermal fields at the same points before
		  reconstructing the heterogeneous heat source field. In the
		  present case, the constitutive parameter of the Neo-Hookean
		  model has been identified, and its distribution has been
		  characterized with respect to the strain state at the
		  surface of a cross-shaped specimen.}

		  growth during anodization is numerically simulated in

		  the barrier layer thickness and pore diameter, time
		  evolution of the current density, scalloped shape of the
		  barrier layer, and the extreme difference in the reaction
		  rates between pore bottoms and pore walls, are successfully
		  predicted. Our simulations revealed the existence of a

		  retinal photoreceptor cells separate, typically from the
		  underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). By computing
		  the total fluid volume flow arising from transretinal,
		  vascular and RPE pump currents, we determine the conditions
		  under which the subretinal fluid pressure exceeds the
		  maximum yield stress holding the retina and RPE together,
		  giving rise to an irreversible, extended retinal
		  delamination. We also investigate localized, blister-like
		  retinal detachments by balancing mechanical tension in the
		  retina with both the retina–RPE adhesion energy and the
		  hydraulic pressure jump across the retina. For detachments
		  induced by traction forces, we find a critical radius
		  beyond which the blister is unstable to growth. Growth of a
		  detached blister can also be driven by inflamed lesions in
		  which the tissue has a higher choroidal hydraulic
		  conductivity, has insufficient RPE pump activity, or has
		  defective adhesion bonds. We determine the parameter
		  regimes in which the blister either becomes unstable to
		  growth, remains stable and finite-sized, or shrinks,
		  allowing possible healing. The corresponding stable blister
		  radius and shape are calculated. Our analysis provides a
		  quantitative description of the physical mechanisms
		  involved in exudative retinal detachments and can help
		  guide the development of retinal reattachment protocols or
		  preventative procedures.}

		  to analyse the calorific manifestations accompanying
		  elastoplastic transformation during tensile tests. The
		  surface temperature images are provided by an experimental
		  set-up essentially made of a testing machine coupled with
		  an infrared camera equipped with a home-made numerizer. The
		  `inverse' passage from temperatures to heat sources is
		  detailed in the case of flat and thin parallelepipedic
		  samples. The infrared image processing, based on
		  Fourier’s techniques, was checked using spectral
		  solutions of the heat equation in the case of realistic
		  examples close to experiments. Numerical simulations are
		  shown which attest coherence and efficiency of the method
		  for several heat source distributions and different sets of
		  noisy data. The method is then applied to experimental data
		  files coming from tensile tests on mild steels at the room
		  temperature. Sudden dissipative effects due to the
		  propagation of the Lüders bands during the plastic plateau
		  can be observed. Then, during the strain hardening, gradual
		  and precocious concentrations of dissipation are shown;
		  they herald the local necking of the sample. Finally, the
		  interest of such experimental results is briefly discussed
		  by referring to the specialised literature dealing with
		  localisation phenomena and behaviour identification."

  abstract	= "Subduction initiation is a key in understanding the
		  dynamic evolution of the Earth and its fundamental
		  difference to all other rocky planetary bodies in our solar
		  system. Despite recent progress, the question about how a
		  stiff, mostly stagnant planetary lid can break and become
		  part in the global overturn of the mantle is still
		  unresolved. Many mechanisms, externally or internally
		  driven, are proposed in previous studies. Here, we present
		  the results on subduction initiation obtained by
		  dynamically self-consistent, time-dependent numerical
		  modelling of mantle convection. We show that the stress
		  distribution and resulting deformation of the lithosphere
		  are strongly controlled by the top boundary formulation: A
		  free surface enables surface topography and plate bending,
		  increases gravitational sliding of the plates and leads to
		  more realistic, lithosphere-scale shear zones. As a
		  consequence, subduction initiation induced by regional
		  mantle flow is demonstrably favoured by a free surface
		  compared to the commonly applied, vertically fixed (i.e.
		  free-slip) surface. In addition, we present global,
		  three-dimensional mantle convection experiments that employ
		  basal heating that leads to narrow mantle plumes. Narrow
		  mantle plumes impinging on the base of the plate cause
		  locally weak plate segments and a large topography at the
		  lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. Both are shown to be
		  key to induce subduction initiation. Finally, our model
		  self-consistently reproduces an episodic lid with a fast
		  global overturn due to the hotter mantle developed below a
		  former stagnant lid. We conclude that once in a
		  stagnant-lid mode, a planet (like Venus) might
		  preferentially evolve by temporally discrete, global
		  overturn events rather than by a continuous recycling of
		  lid and that this is something worth testing more
		  rigorously in future studies.",

		  terms of three natural strain invariants, K1–3, which
		  respectively specify the amount-of-dilatation, the
		  magnitude-of-distortion, and the mode-of-distortion.
		  Distortion is that part of the deformation that does not
		  dilate. Moreover, pure dilatation (K2=0), pure shear
		  (K3=0), uniaxial extension (K3=1), and uniaxial contraction
		  (K3=−1) are tests which hold a strain invariant constant.
		  Through an analysis of previously published data, it is
		  shown for rubber that this new approach allows W to be
		  easily determined with improved accuracy. Albeit useful for
		  large and small strains, distinct advantage is shown for
		  moderate strains (e.g. 2–25\%). Central to this work is
		  the orthogonal nature of the invariant basis. If η
		  represents natural strain, then {K1,K2,K3} are such that
		  the tensorial contraction of (∂Ki/∂η) with
		  (∂Kj/∂η) vanishes when i≠j. This result, in turn,
		  allows the Cauchy stress t to be expressed as the sum of
		  three response terms that are mutually orthogonal. In
		  particular (summation implied) t=Ai∂W/∂Ki, where the
		  ∂W/∂Ki are scalar response functions and the Ai are

		  Maxwell--Stefan diffusion systems for chemically reacting
		  fluids with different molar masses and reversible reactions
		  are investigated. The diffusion matrix of the system is
		  generally neither symmetric nor positive definite, but the
		  equations admit a formal gradient-flow structure which
		  provides entropy (free energy) estimates. The main result
		  is the exponential decay to the unique equilibrium with a
		  rate that is constructive up to a finite-dimensional
		  inequality. The key elements of the proof are the existence
		  of a unique detailed-balance equilibrium and the derivation
		  of an inequality relating the entropy and the entropy
		  production. The main difficulty comes from the fact that
		  the reactions are represented by molar fractions while the
		  conservation laws hold for the concentrations. The idea is
		  to enlarge the space of n partial concentrations by adding
		  the total concentration, viewed as an independent variable,
		  thus working with {\$}{\$}n+1{\$}{\$}n+1 variables. Further
		  results concern the existence of global bounded weak
		  solutions to the parabolic system and an extension of the
		  results to complex-balance systems.},

  abstract	= { This paper offers a reappraisal of Fung's model for
		  quasi-linear viscoelasticity. It is shown that a number of
		  negative features exhibited in other works, commonly
		  attributed to the Fung approach, are merely a consequence
		  of the way it has been applied. The approach outlined
		  herein is shown to yield improved behaviour and offers a
		  straightforward scheme for solving a wide range of models.
		  Results from the new model are contrasted with those in the
		  literature for the case of uniaxial elongation of a bar:
		  for an imposed stretch of an incompressible bar and for an
		  imposed load. In the latter case, a numerical solution to a
		  Volterra integral equation is required to obtain the
		  results. This is achieved by a high-order discretization
		  scheme. Finally, the stretch of a compressible viscoelastic
		  bar is determined for two distinct materials:
		  Horgan–Murphy and Gent. }

		  We focus on phase oscillator models that are widespread in
		  real-world synchronization phenomena, that generalize the
		  celebrated Kuramoto model, and that feature a rich
		  phenomenology. We review the history and the countless
		  applications of this model throughout science and

		  describe some selected applications relevant to control
		  scientists, including vehicle coordination, electric power
		  networks, and clock synchronization. We introduce the
		  reader to several synchronization notions and performance
		  estimates. We propose analysis approaches to phase and
		  frequency synchronization, phase balancing, pattern
		  formation, and partial synchronization. We present the
		  sharpest known results about synchronization in networks of
		  homogeneous and heterogeneous oscillators, with complete or
		  sparse interconnection topologies, and in
		  finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional settings. We
		  conclude by summarizing the limitations of existing

		  In this paper we first describe some experimental results
		  that illustrate stress softening in particle-reinforced
		  rubber together with associated residual strain effects. In
		  particular, the results show how the stress softening and
		  residual strain change with the magnitude of the applied
		  strain. Then, on the basis of these data a constitutive
		  model is derived to describe this behaviour. The theory of
		  pseudo-elasticity is used for this model, the basis of
		  which is the inclusion of two variables in the energy
		  function in order separately to capture the stress
		  softening and residual strain effects. The dissipation of
		  energy, i.e. the difference between the energy input during
		  loading and the energy returned on unloading is also
		  accounted for in the model by the use of a dissipation
		  function, which evolves with the deformation history."

  abstract	= "The thermodynamics and mechanics of non-isothermal
		  polymeric fluids are examined within the auspices of a new
		  methodology wherein the laws of physics and principles of
		  mechanics which are applicable to these thermodynamic
		  systems are imbedded in a definite mathematical structure
		  of a general, abstract equation. Such a concept allows new
		  insight to be obtained concerning some aspects of
		  non-isothermal flows of polymeric fluids, and permits a
		  consistent expression and interpretation of other
		  thermodynamic theories for these systems which have been
		  developed over the past forty years. A major portion of
		  this article is devoted to demonstrating the above
		  statements, and in so doing some common misconceptions
		  occurring in a significant fraction of the literature
		  regarding this subject are exposed. The definite
		  mathematical structure of the new methodology permits the
		  thermodynamically consistent generalization of isothermal,
		  incompressible models of polymeric fluids to
		  non-isothermal, compressible conditions. Doing thus
		  reproduces, corrects, and extends non-isothermal models
		  which have been developed over the years, and also allows
		  for simpler (but equivalent) representations of these
		  models in terms of alternate variables with a clearer
		  connection to the microstructure of the material than the
		  stress tensor and heat flux vector fields. Furthermore, a
		  generalization of the GENERIC structure is proposed that
		  accommodates interactions between phenomena of differing
		  parities, which impose antisymmetry upon the corresponding
		  elements of the dissipative operator matrix.",

		  into a lower-degree subspace makes differentiation

		  without any row deletions. Then, boundary and interface

		  resulting method is both flexible and robust, and avoids
		  ambiguities that arise when applying the classical row
		  deletion method outside of two-point scalar boundary-value
		  problems. The new method is the basis for ordinary

  abstract	= "We consider the existence of solutions for a non-Newtonian
		  fluid that is based upon a nonlinear dumb-bell model. It is
		  shown that a rigorous existence proof can be obtained for
		  solutions on a bounded domain at arbitrary values of
		  Deborah number provided the model includes a spatial
		  diffusion term that is usually neglected in the derivation
		  of the model by assuming that the structure is spatially
		  homogeneous. Although this diffusion term is critical to
		  the existence proof, it is expected to be numerically small
		  compared to other terms in the constitutive model, except
		  possibly in the vicinity of very large stress gradients,
		  which it will tend to smooth out. The proof also requires
		  that the stress always remain bounded. Although it is
		  likely that this will be true for a model with a nonlinear
		  (FENE) spring, it is difficult to prove rigorously. Hence,
		  in the existence proof we resort to an ad hoc assumption
		  that is equivalent to asserting that the polymer breaks
		  (degrades) if the end-to-end distance exceeds some
		  prescribed values that is less than the full cotour length
		  but is otherwise arbitrary. "

  abstract	= { Nonlinear systems of partial differential equations
		  (PDEs) may permit several distinct solutions. The typical
		  current approach to finding distinct solutions is to start
		  Newton's method with many different initial guesses, hoping
		  to find starting points that lie in different basins of
		  attraction. In this paper, we present an
		  infinite-dimensional deflation algorithm for systematically
		  modifying the residual of a nonlinear PDE problem to
		  eliminate known solutions from consideration. This enables
		  the Newton--Kantorovitch iteration to converge to several
		  different solutions, even starting from the same initial
		  guess. The deflated Jacobian is dense, but an efficient
		  preconditioning strategy is devised, and the number of
		  Krylov iterations is observed not to grow as solutions are
		  deflated. The power of the approach is demonstrated on
		  several problems from special functions, phase separation,
		  differential geometry, and fluid mechanics that permit
		  distinct solutions. }

		  the Onsager, Prigogine as well as the Glansdorff and
		  Ziegler thermodynamic extremal principles (TEPs) to
		  non-equilibrium thermodynamics are examined for systems at
		  fixed temperature with respect to their ability to provide
		  kinetic equations approved in materials science. TEPs
		  represent an alternative to the classical phenomenological
		  equations approach. As TEPs are, more or less, a pure
		  mathematical tool, they cannot significantly contribute to
		  a deeper physical understanding. However, if a system can
		  be described by discrete characteristic (thermodynamic)
		  parameters, it is demonstrated that application of
		  Onsager’s TEP or Ziegler’s TEP represents a systematic
		  way to derive a set of explicit evolution equations for
		  these parameters. This approach can significantly simplify
		  the treatment of the problem and, thus, can also be applied
		  to rather complex systems, for which the classical
		  approach, involving application of phenomenological
		  equations, fails. The application of TEPs is demonstrated
		  on plasticity with respect to constitutive equations as
		  well as on grain growth and coarsening with respect to
		  evolution equations of discrete parameters. No exploitation
		  of Prigogine’s TEP has been reported for applications in
		  materials science. Contrarily, Prigogine’s TEP can be
		  invalidated if the coefficients of the dissipation function
		  depend on the evolution of state variables with time. This
		  is demonstrated by a further practical example worked out
		  for the solute drag phenomenon. Glansdorff’s and
		  Prigogine’s evolution criterion, however, is always
		  fulfilled near the equilibrium state of convex Gibbs
		  energy. Extensions of TEPs to non-linear non-equilibrium
		  thermodynamics are demonstrated for homogeneous and
		  quasi-homogeneous dissipation functions."

		  of distortion. Three homogeneous deformations illustrate
		  similarities and differences between the logarithms of

		  the literature to model the dynamics of two-phase fluids.
		  One main purpose of this paper consists in (re-)deriving
		  NSAC, NSCH and NSK from first principles, in the spirit of
		  rational mechanics, for fluids of very general constitutive
		  laws. For NSAC, this deduction confirms and extends a
		  proposal of Blesgen. Regarding NSCH, it continues work of
		  Lowengrub and Truskinovsky and provides the apparently
		  first justified formulation in the non-isothermal case. For
		  NSK, it yields a most natural correction to the formulation
		  by Dunn and Serrin. The paper uniformly recovers as
		  examples various classes of fluids, distinguished according
		  to whether none, one, or both of the phases are
		  compressible, and according to the nature of their
		  co-existence. The latter is captured not only by the mixing
		  energy, but also by a `mixing rule'---a constitutive law
		  that characterizes the type of the mixing. A second main
		  purpose of the paper is to communicate the apparently new
		  observation that in the case of two immiscible
		  incompressible phases of different temperature-independent
		  specific volumes, NSAC reduces literally to NSK. This
		  finding may be considered as an independent justification
		  of NSK. An analogous fact is shown for NSCH, which under
		  the same assumption reduces to a new non-local version of
		  NSK.",

		  flows are investigated and the response of the bulk stress

		  end-to-end length of the dumbbell, which arises from the
		  variable friction factor, is found to depend strongly on
		  both the flow type (i.e. the ratio of vorticity to the rate

		  internal viscosity is examined in detail using two methods
		  of solution for the problems of transient and steady
		  two-dimensional flows. The first method uses a perturbation
		  expansion valid for small values of the internal viscosity
		  and leads largely to analytical results. The second
		  technique uses the pre-averaging approximation of Cerf and
		  is capable of predicting the model response when the
		  internal viscosity becomes large. The most striking result
		  for large values of the internal viscosity and a linear
		  spring dumbbell is the appearance of multiple steady states
		  in the dumbbell length for flows between simple shear and
		  pure straining, and the removal of the well known
		  singularity in end-to-end length which otherwise appears in
		  the linear dumbbell model at a critical value of the strain

		  time direction is usually not used for parallelization. But
		  when parallelization in space saturates, the time direction
		  offers itself as a further direction for parallelization.
		  The time direction is however special, and for evolution
		  problems there is a causality principle: the solution later
		  in time is affected (it is even determined) by the solution
		  earlier in time, but not the other way round. Algorithms
		  trying to use the time direction for parallelization must

		  of the time dimension into account.We show in this chapter
		  how time domain decomposition methods were invented, and
		  give an overview of the existing techniques. Time parallel
		  methods can be classified into four different groups:
		  methods based on multiple shooting, methods based on domain
		  decomposition and waveform relaxation, space-time multigrid
		  methods and direct time parallel methods. We show for each
		  of these techniques the main inventions over time by

  abstract	= "Abstract In the last decade considerable interest has
		  emerged in understanding and modeling the flow behavior of
		  concentrated wormlike micellar solutions. A significant
		  advance was made through the two-species modeling approach
		  originally proposed by Vasquez, Cook, and McKinley. In the
		  present work we revisit their model from a nonequilibrium
		  thermodynamic perspective. By employing an extension to the
		  nonequilibrium treatment of chemical reaction kinetics for
		  media with an internal structure, we develop a
		  thermodynamic model that closely resembles the one based on
		  more ad hoc assumptions. Thus, we not only validate that

		  dimensional model for rubber when Hencky strain is written
		  as an explicit function of the Cauchy stress is examined.
		  Based on the experimental evidence, vulcanized unfilled
		  rubber is assumed to be isotropic, incompressible, and
		  deforming from a stress-free reference configuration.
		  Vulcanized unfilled rubber undergoes strain-induced
		  crystallization when uniaxial stretch exceeds 2. Therefore,
		  in this study, a non-dissipative model is sought for rubber
		  only till the von Mises stress is below a critical value.
		  Using the biaxial response reported in Kawabata et al.
		  (1981), the material functions are arrived adopting Rivlin
		  and Saunders methodology. The material constants in the
		  determined material functions are found using biaxial tests
		  for four other experimental studies on rubber reported in
		  the literature. The ability of the arrived constitutive
		  model to describe the uniaxial and equal biaxial response
		  of the same rubber is evaluated. The proposed model is
		  benchmarked with established models in the classical
		  framework. Among the models studied the proposed model
		  performed as well as the other models for Kawabata et al.

		  the remaining four experimental data sets. However, while
		  the proposed model performance does not critically depend
		  on the experiments used to deduce the material parameters,
		  for the other models the material parameters need to be
		  found from fixed biaxial experiments for better
		  performance."

		  problems and finite-dimensional sum-of-squares optimization
		  problems. We further show that subject to minor technical
		  constraints, a general polynomial Lyapunov function is
		  always guaranteed to provide better results than the

		  the maximum Reynolds number for which a flow is globally
		  stable, if the flow does remain globally stable for

  abstract	= {Following our first report (A Groisman and V Steinberg
		  2000 Nature 405 53), we present an extended account of
		  experimental observations of elasticity-induced turbulence
		  in three different systems: a swirling flow between two
		  plates, a Couette–Taylor (CT) flow between two cylinders,
		  and a flow in a curvilinear channel (Dean flow). All three
		  set-ups had a high ratio of the width of the region
		  available for flow to the radius of curvature of the
		  streamlines. The experiments were carried out with dilute
		  solutions of high-molecular-weight polyacrylamide in
		  concentrated sugar syrups. High polymer relaxation time and
		  solution viscosity ensured prevalence of non-linear elastic
		  effects over inertial non-linearity, and development of
		  purely elastic instabilities at low Reynolds number ( Re )
		  in all three flows. Above the elastic instability
		  threshold, flows in all three systems exhibit features of
		  developed turbulence. They include: (i) randomly
		  fluctuating fluid motion excited in a broad range of
		  spatial and temporal scales and (ii) significant increase
		  in the rates of momentum and mass transfer (compared with
		  those expected for a steady flow with a smooth velocity
		  profile). Phenomenology, driving mechanisms and parameter
		  dependence of the elastic turbulence are compared with
		  those of the conventional high- Re hydrodynamic turbulence
		  in Newtonian fluids. Some similarities as well as multiple
		  principal differences were found. In two out of three
		  systems (swirling flow between two plates and flow in the
		  curvilinear channel), power spectra of velocity
		  fluctuations decayed rather quickly, following power laws
		  with exponents of about −3.5. It suggests that, being
		  random in time, the flow is rather smooth in space, in the
		  sense that the main contribution to deformation and mixing
		  (and, possibly, elastic energy) is coming from flow at the
		  largest scale of the system. This situation, random in time
		  and smooth in space, is analogous to flows at small scales
		  (below the Kolmogorov dissipation scale) in high- Re
		  turbulence.}

		  simplicity that it is possible to characterize the reaction
		  as having a single step and as one in which the reaction
		  products remain within the body, thereby modifying the
		  solid constituent. The effects of the reaction on the solid
		  that render it anisotropic are quantified by means of a
		  tensorial parameter that tracks the extent of the reaction
		  in different directions. Both diffusion-dominated
		  (diffusion of the reactants is far more rapid than the
		  reaction) and reaction-dominated (the reaction is far more
		  rapid than the diffusion of the reactants) processes are
		  considered. Constitutive equations are derived from the
		  requirement that the rate of entropy production be
		  maximized, which makes it possible to characterize the
		  behavior of the body through the specification of three
		  scalar functions: the rate of entropy production function
		  for the mixture, and the Helmholtz free energies of each of
		  the constituents. It is noted that the model may be applied
		  to regions of bodies with locally homogeneous damage, that
		  is, regions damaged at a small enough scale to mimic an
		  anisotropically porous continuum. Macroscale damage may
		  also be modeled via the boundary conditions described in

		  the coupled photomechanical behavior of light activated

		  aspects for finite element simulations at the engineering
		  scale. The photomechanical continuum framework is
		  summarized, and some specific constitutive equations for

		  multiphysics governing partial differential equations takes
		  the form of a user defined element subroutine within the
		  commercial software package ABAQUS. We verify our
		  two‐dimensional and three‐dimensional finite element
		  procedure for multiple analytically tractable cases. To
		  show the robustness of the numerical implementation,

  abstract	= {A thermodynamically consistent theory is developed capable
		  of modelling a mushy zone, that is a region of mixed solid
		  phase and liquid phase that can occur during the cooling of
		  a binary alloy. The solid phase forms as a matrix of
		  crystals--often dendrites--which resembles a porous medium
		  of spatially varying permeability. This permeability
		  diminishes in time as further solid freezes out of the
		  liquid phase as it percolates through the matrix. The
		  theory developed here is general enough to incorporate
		  these and other ingredients essential to a proper
		  theoretical treatment of a mushy zone. A simple
		  one-dimensional freezing problem is formulated and solved.

  abstract	= "We study the pressure-driven unidirectional flow of a
		  viscoelastic fluid with pressure-dependent viscosity in a
		  straight channel and a circular tube. The upper convected
		  Maxwell (UCM) constitutive equation is utilized to model
		  the response of the viscoelastic fluid under deformation.
		  The starting point of the analysis is based on the
		  second-order, symmetric conformation tensor. As such, the
		  final model is slightly different from previous models in
		  terms of the extra-stress tensor as the primary variable.
		  The solution of the governing equations is found
		  analytically for all the dependent variables except for a
		  constant which is introduced by the separation of variables
		  method. A physical singular point of the solution is also
		  revealed explicitly. The singularity is taken into account
		  in order to construct very accurate high-order asymptotic
		  solutions for the unknown constant. Further reprocessing of
		  the asymptotic solutions by means of non-linear techniques
		  which accelerate the convergence of series, result in more
		  accurate analytical expressions even close to the
		  singularity of the solutions."

  abstract	= { With the goal of providing the first example of
		  application of a recently proposed method, thus
		  demonstrating its ability to give results in principle,
		  global stability of a version of the rotating Couette flow
		  is examined. The flow depends on the Reynolds number and a
		  parameter characterizing the magnitude of the Coriolis
		  force. By converting the original Navier–Stokes equations
		  to a finite-dimensional uncertain dynamical system using a
		  partial Galerkin expansion, high-degree polynomial Lyapunov
		  functionals were found by sum-of-squares of polynomials
		  optimization. It is demonstrated that the proposed method
		  allows obtaining the exact global stability limit for this
		  flow in a range of values of the parameter characterizing
		  the Coriolis force. Outside this range a lower bound for
		  the global stability limit was obtained, which is still
		  better than the energy stability limit. In the course of
		  the study, several results meaningful in the context of the
		  method used were also obtained. Overall, the results
		  obtained demonstrate the applicability of the recently
		  proposed approach to global stability of the fluid flows.
		  To the best of our knowledge, it is the first case in which
		  global stability of a fluid flow has been proved by a
		  generic method for the value of a Reynolds number greater
		  than that which could be achieved with the energy stability
		  approach. }

		  two-cluster attractors with similarity have a large basin
		  volume, which are reduced to a unique circle map through a
		  scaling transformation with two parameters. The PO phase is
		  characterized by the increase of partition complexity. In
		  the phase, chaotic itinerancy is observed, whose dynamics
		  consists of quasistationary high-dimensional chaotic
		  motion, low-dimensional attractor ruins, and switching
		  among them. Dependence of the diffusion constant on the
		  size and the nonlinearity clearly deviates from that by a
		  random phase approximation, suggesting remaining

		  is examined using two quasi-static linear theories and an
		  integration of the full time-dependent linearized
		  disturbance equations. The full theory predicts absolute
		  stability within the investigated range and perhaps for all
		  the Reynolds numbers. A given wavenumber disturbance of a
		  Stokes layer is found to be more stable than that of the
		  motionless state (zero Reynolds number). The quasi-static
		  theories predict strong inflexional instabilities. The
		  failure of the quasi-static theories is discussed. }

  abstract	= {This article introduces and reviews recent work using a
		  simple optimization technique for analysing the nonlinear
		  stability of a state in a dynamical system. The technique
		  can be used to identify the most efficient way to disturb a
		  system such that it transits from one stable state to
		  another. The key idea is introduced within the framework of
		  a finite-dimensional set of ordinary differential equations
		  (ODEs) and then illustrated for a very simple system of two
		  ODEs which possesses bistability. Then the transition to
		  turbulence problem in fluid mechanics is used to show how
		  the technique can be formulated for a spatially-extended
		  system described by a set of partial differential equations
		  (the well-known Navier–Stokes equations). Within that
		  context, the optimization technique bridges the gap between
		  (linear) optimal perturbation theory and the (nonlinear)
		  dynamical systems approach to fluid flows. The fact that
		  the technique has now been recently shown to work in this
		  very high dimensional setting augurs well for its utility
		  in other physical systems.}

  abstract	= {This review discusses a recently developed optimization
		  technique for analyzing the nonlinear stability of a flow
		  state. It is based on a nonlinear extension of nonmodal
		  analysis and, in its simplest form, consists of finding the
		  disturbance to the flow state of a given amplitude that
		  experiences the largest energy growth at a certain time
		  later. When coupled with a search over the disturbance
		  amplitude, this can reveal the disturbance of least
		  amplitude—called the minimal seed—for transition to
		  another state such as turbulence. The approach bridges the
		  theoretical gap between (linear) nonmodal theory and the
		  (nonlinear) dynamical systems approach to fluid flows by
		  allowing one to explore phase space at a finite distance
		  from the reference flow state. Various ongoing and
		  potential applications of the technique are discussed.}

		  theory of mixtures and provide a critical review from a
		  fresh perspective with the aim to identify limitations and
		  open questions inherent to various versions of the theory.
		  Such a discussion could serve as a guide to the formulation
		  of a model for the problem at hand. We look into the
		  frequently neglected area of kinematic description, drawing
		  from this field criticism of third Truesdell's metaphysical
		  principle. Balance laws are carefully formulated for
		  partial quantities with discontinuities for both theory of
		  interacting continua and for averaging theories. Further,
		  we discuss definitions of mixture quantities together with
		  Truesdell's metaphysical principles. Finally, we use
		  classical irreversible thermodynamics to derive entropy
		  production for mixture as a whole and thus reaching an

		  material. In the present study the theory of mixtures is

		  air in a purely mechanical system in which the thermal
		  effects and chemical reactions are ignored. Constitutive
		  relation for each component of the mixture is assumed to be
		  dependent only on the kinematical quantities associated
		  with each component. The resulting hyperbolic conservation
		  equations are solved by an upwind finite volume scheme
		  coupled with an operator splitting technique for a
		  quasi-static type of loading. The numerical scheme is used

		  thickness of a typical road pavement. "

		  the finitely extendable nonlinear elastic (FENE) chain
		  models which account for molecular stretch, bending, and
		  topology. More coarse-grained descriptions such as
		  primitive path models, and elongated particle models are
		  reviewed as well. We focus on their inherently anisotropic
		  material—in particular rheological—properties via
		  deterministic and stochastic approaches. A number of
		  representative examples are given on how simple (often
		  high-dimensional) models can, and have been implemented in
		  order to enable the analysis of the microscopic origins of
		  the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of polymeric materials.
		  These examples are shown to provide us with a number of
		  routes for developing and establishing coarse-grained
		  (low-dimensional) models devoted to the prediction of a
		  reduced number of significant material properties. At this
		  stage approximations which allow for an analytical
		  treatment are discussed as well. Concerning the types of
		  complex fluids, we cover the range from flexible to
		  semiflexible polymers in melts and solutions, wormlike
		  micelles, structural suspensions including ferrofluids in
		  field-induced anisotropic or liquid crystalline phases."

		  cyclic loadings that, combined with a very low thermal
		  conductivity, leads to a temperature rise called heat
		  build-up in the literature. This phenomenon is especially
		  crucial for antivibration parts that require both good
		  fatigue resistance and high damping properties, involving a
		  high dissipation under cyclic loading. Moreover, these
		  parts exhibit complex shapes leading to complex local
		  mechanical fields and therefore to thermal sources and
		  temperature fields difficult to predict. To overcome the
		  difficulties of the classical approach based on
		  thermodynamically based models and to provide acceptable
		  characterization and computation times for industrial
		  needs, a simple phenomenological approach was previously
		  suggested. We aim at validating this approach for several
		  case studies. First, an identification procedure is
		  proposed to identify efficiently the parameters of the
		  thermal and mechanical problems, from a single test on an
		  hourglass-shaped specimen. The validity of the
		  identification step and of the modeling is then challenged
		  by the confrontation of the numerical predictions to the
		  results of an extended experimental database. The
		  influences of the main influent factors are investigated
		  (displacement amplitude, frequency, load ratio, sample
		  volume) for tension and torsion tests on hourglass-shaped
		  samples. The validity of the approach is asserted both on
		  transient and stabilized temperature fields, for a
		  temperature rise lower than 20 °C.}",

  abstract	= "Simple rheological equations that describe non-linear
		  viscoelastic phenomena in polymeric liquids have long
		  attracted the attention of many rheologists. Although there
		  are many ways of deriving such equations, only one concept
		  is considered here. This concept is based on the
		  introduction of an internal parameter, the recoverable
		  strain tenson, and arises from a special kinematic study
		  together with the formalism of irreversible thermodynamics.
		  The main part of the paper sets out the theory for a single
		  mode but a multimode extension is demonstrated towards the
		  end and is compared with experimental data. Finally some of
		  the problems that remain unsolved in the theory are
		  discussed. The aim of this paper is to acquaint rheologists
		  with the author's views as the model rheological equations
		  he developed have recently been discussed in the literature
		  without his participation."

  abstract	= "Recently, the so-called Very High Bond (VHB in short) tape
		  has proven to be an ideal polymer for producing devices
		  made of electric field-responsive functional materials,
		  e.g., actuators in soft robotics, stretch sensors in
		  wearable devices, and energy harvesters generating power
		  from ambient motions. The VHB polymer is commercially
		  available in several thicknesses. For this study, we have
		  selected VHB 4905 due to its wide use as a common material
		  for dielectric elastomers. The acrylic-based polymer is
		  highly deformable, extremely viscoelastic, and highly
		  sensitive to temperature fluctuations. Hence, in order to
		  understand its mechanical and electro-mechanical behaviour,
		  extensive experiments need to be conducted to unravel
		  temperature dependencies in addition to strain-rate
		  dependences. In this study, we present a wide variety of
		  temperature experiments ranging from -30°C to 80°C at
		  various strain rates and stretch levels under homogeneous
		  deformation and temperature fields. The study demonstrates
		  a pronounced influence of the temperature on the mechanical
		  response of the VHB polymer. For VHB within the temperature
		  range of our study, an increased temperature mechanically
		  softens the material and vice-versa. After conducting a
		  wide range of experiments, we propose a finite strain
		  thermo-viscoelastic constitutive model that is an extension
		  of a phenomenologically-motivated model where a non-linear
		  evolution law is devised based on the classical concept of
		  the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation
		  gradient. Then, decoupled one-dimensional equations are
		  derived and fitted to experimental data to identify
		  relevant material parameters appearing in the model. The
		  thermo-viscoelastic model validation shows its reasonably
		  good capability to predict the experimental results."

  abstract	= "This essay investigates the temperature dependence of the
		  mechanical properties of a filler-loaded tread compound
		  experimentally and proposes a physically based method to
		  represent this behaviour in the framework of non-linear
		  continuum thermomechanics. To this end, we realise a series
		  of monotonic and cyclic strain controlled tests on
		  cylindrical specimens in tension at different temperature
		  levels. The experimental data show the isothermal
		  mechanical behaviour to be mainly influenced by non-linear
		  elasticity in combination with non-linear rate dependence
		  and weak equilibrium hysteresis. We observe that the rate
		  sensitivity of the material depends strongly on the
		  temperature : at low temperature levels, the rate
		  sensitivity is essentially higher than at high
		  temperatures. The elastic properties of the material depend
		  comparatively less on the temperature. Nevertheless, higher
		  temperature levels lead to higher equilibrium stresses. In
		  order to represent the material behaviour, we start with a
		  multiplicative split of the deformation gradient into a
		  mechanical and a thermal part as proposed by Lu and Pister
		  (1975). Physically, this idea corresponds to a stress-free
		  thermal expansion followed by an isothermal
		  stress-producing deformation. We suppose the thermal part
		  of the deformation gradient to be isotropic. As a
		  consequence of this, the velocity gradient decomposes
		  additively into a pure thermal and a pure mechanical part.
		  By using these elements, we exploit the Clausius Duhem
		  inequality and assume the so-called ‘mechanical second
		  Piola Kirchhoff stress tensor’ to be a functional of the
		  ‘mechanical Green's strain tensor’. In a further step,
		  we define this functional by a system of constitutive
		  equations which are based on a rheological model. The
		  evolution equations for the internal variables are
		  formulated by using the concept of dual variables proposed
		  by Haupt and Tsakmakis (1989, 1996). The rate sensitivity
		  is modelled by a stress and temperature dependent viscosity
		  function. The elastic part of the equilibrium stress is
		  described by entropy elasticity in combination with a
		  modified Mooney Rivlin strain energy function. The
		  equilibrium hysteresis effects are represented by rate
		  independent plasticity in arclength representation as
		  proposed by Valanis (1971). The constitutive model is
		  compatible with the dissipation principle of thermodynamics
		  and describes the general trend of the experimental data
		  fairly well."

		  in the constitutive description of the bulk, as well as in

  abstract	= {One of the fundamental problems in simulating the motion
		  of sharp interfaces between immiscible fluids is a
		  description of the transition that occurs when the
		  interfaces merge and reconnect. It is well known that
		  classical methods involving sharp interfaces fail to
		  describe this type of phenomena. Following some previous
		  work in this area, we suggest a physically motivated
		  regularization of the Euler equations which allows
		  topological transitions to occur smoothly. In this model,
		  the sharp interface is replaced by a narrow transition
		  layer across which the fluids may mix. The model describes
		  a flow of a binary mixture, and the internal structure of
		  the interface is determined by both diffusion and motion.
		  An advantage of our regularization is that it automatically
		  yields a continuous description of surface tension, which
		  can play an important role in topological transitions. An
		  additional scalar field is introduced to describe the
		  concentration of one of the fluid components and the
		  resulting system of equations couples the Euler (or
		  Navier{\textendash}Stokes) and the
		  Cahn{\textendash}Hilliard equations. The model takes into
		  account weak non{\textendash}locality (dispersion)
		  associated with an internal length scale and localized
		  dissipation due to mixing. The non{\textendash}locality
		  introduces a dimensional surface energy; dissipation is
		  added to handle the loss of regularity of solutions to the
		  sharp interface equations and to provide a mechanism for
		  topological changes. In particular, we study a
		  non{\textendash}trivial limit when both components are
		  incompressible, the pressure is kinematic but the velocity
		  field is non{\textendash}solenoidal
		  (quasi{\textendash}incompressibility). To demonstrate the
		  effects of quasi{\textendash}incompressibility, we analyse
		  the linear stage of spinodal decomposition in one
		  dimension. We show that when the densities of the fluids
		  are not perfectly matched, the evolution of the
		  concentration field causes fluid motion even if the fluids
		  are inviscid. In the limit of infinitely thin and
		  well{\textendash}separated interfacial layers, an
		  appropriately scaled quasi{\textendash}incompressible
		  Euler{\textendash}Cahn{\textendash}Hilliard system
		  converges to the classical sharp interface model. In order
		  to investigate the behaviour of the model outside the range
		  of parameters where the sharp interface approximation is
		  sufficient, we consider a simple example of a change of
		  topology and show that the model permits the transition to
		  occur without an associated singularity.},

		  simulating flows of polymeric fluids are discussed in the
		  chapter. These methods are based on coupling macroscopic
		  techniques for solving the conservation equations with
		  microscopic methods for determining the polymeric stress in
		  the fluid. Some of the early attempts to reduce the
		  statistical error in the stochastic simulations without
		  increasing the number of realizations are described in the
		  chapter. Some of the major advances in the development and
		  implementation of micro-macro techniques presented, such as
		  the method of Brownian configuration fields of Hulsen, van
		  Heel, and van den Brule. The chapter also describes
		  efficient implicit schemes for micro-macro simulations
		  developed by Laso, Ramírez, and Picasso. These schemes
		  give rise to a large nonlinear system of algebraic
		  equations for both the macroscopic and microscopic degrees
		  of freedom at each time step with efficiency being achieved
		  using size reduction techniques. A brief account of the
		  solution of stochastic differential equations for linear
		  polymer melts based on the Doi–Edwards model is discussed
		  in the chapter. The deterministic numerical methods based
		  on the Fokker–Planck equation for several kinetic theory
		  models of polymer fluids are discussed in the chapter."

  abstract	= "One of the distinguishing features of elastomeric
		  materials, which consist of a network of flexible polymeric
		  chains, is that the deformation response is dominated by
		  changes in entropy. Accordingly, most classical theories of
		  rubber-like elasticity consider only the entropy and
		  neglect any changes in internal energy. On the other hand,
		  the fracture of strongly cross-linked elastomers is
		  essentially energy dominated, as argued in the well-known
		  Lake–Thomas model for the toughness of elastomers.
		  However, a single model unifying these two phenomena is
		  still lacking. We provide a rational yet simple model for
		  deformation and fracture of cross-linked polymers, based on
		  two ingredients: (i) a non-Gaussian statistical mechanics
		  model of polymer chains that accounts for the increase in
		  energy due to the deformation of molecular bonds; (ii) a
		  chain scission criterion based on the bond deformation
		  energy attaining a critical value. Using this model, we can
		  estimate the rupture stretch of elastomeric materials from
		  fundamental quantities describing the polymer network. We
		  use this model to relate the flaw sensitivity of elastomers
		  to an intrinsic material length scale related to the
		  network structure."

		  deduced from temperature fields by using the heat diffusion
		  equation. First, the results show that no mechanical
		  (intrinsic) dissipation is detected for weakly filled SBR,
		  meaning that the heat produced and absorbed over one
		  mechanical cycle is the same whatever the stretch ratio
		  reached. Second, the mechanical dissipation in highly
		  filled SBR is significant. The quantitative analysis
		  carried out highlights the fact that it increases
		  quasi-linearly with the stretch ratio. Finally, a
		  simplified framework is proposed to discuss the

  abstract	= "Abstract The thermomechanics of continua with internal
		  variables of state is often presented as an alternative to
		  rational continuum mechanics or an extension of the
		  classical linear theory of irreversible processes. It has
		  become ubiquitous in the theories of dissipative mechanical
		  phenomena such as viscoelasticity, plasticity, damage,
		  phase transformations in deformable solids, and the
		  rheology of many fluids. The present contribution
		  highlights the historical development of this fruitful
		  approach since the early works of Duhem, Bridgman, and
		  Eckart, and then the quite definite framework more recently
		  delineated in studies by Kestin and Muschik. It peruses the
		  vast field of successful applications in both solid and
		  fluid mechanics as well as in the theory of coupled fields
		  in the second half of the twentieth century. It also
		  necessarily envisages further generalizations of –
		  deviations from, and contradictions with – this well
		  defined framework with the introduction of gradients, and
		  the difficulties posed by these in the interpretation of
		  the variables. Globally, this pragmatic approach has proved
		  its efficiency in dealing with complex behaviours of
		  continua over a period that started more than a hundred
		  years ago with ideas put forward by Duhem. “So hidden in
		  this hocus-pocus There lies the gift of double focus”

		  constitutive equations based on a thermodynamic framework.
		  The model was applied to a semi-crystalline polyamide
		  polymer, PA66. The experiments included tension and shear
		  testing coupled with synchronized digital image correlation
		  and infrared measurements device for capturing the time,
		  temperature, and stress state dependence, as well as the
		  complex thermomechanical coupling exhibited by the material
		  under large deformation. A notion of equivalent strain rate
		  (based on the time–temperature principle superposition)
		  was also introduced to show its capability to build master
		  curves and therefore decrease the number of testing needed
		  to build a material database. The model is based on the
		  Edward Vilgis theory (1986) and accounts for chains network
		  reorganization under external loading through the
		  introduction of an evolution equation for the internal
		  state variable, η¯, representing the degree of mobility
		  of entanglement points. The model accounting for the
		  equivalent strain rate notion was calibrated using master
		  curves. The thermomechanical model agreed well with the
		  experimental mechanical and temperature measurements under
		  tension and shear conditions. The approach developed in
		  this study may open a different way to model the polymer
		  behavior.}

  abstract	= "The paper presents a phenomenological material model for a
		  superimposed elastic–viscoelastic–plastoelastic stress
		  response with damage at large strains and considers details
		  of its numerical implementation. The formulation is
		  suitable for the simulation of carbon-black filled rubbers
		  in monotonic and cyclic deformation processes under
		  isothermal conditions. The underlying key approach is an
		  experimentally motivated a priori decomposition of the
		  local stress response into three constitutive branches
		  which act in parallel: a rubber–elastic ground–stress
		  response, a rate-dependent viscoelastic overstress response
		  and a rate-independent plastoelastic overstress response.
		  The damage is assumed to act isotropically on all three
		  branches. These three branches are represented in a
		  completely analogous format within separate eigenvalue
		  spaces, where we apply a recently proposed compact setting
		  of finite inelasticity based on developing reference metric
		  tensors. On the numerical side, we propose a time
		  integration scheme which exploits intrinsically the modular
		  structure of the proposed constitutive model. This is
		  achieved on the basis of a convenient operator split of the
		  local evolution system, which we decouple into a stress
		  evolution problem and a parameter evolution problem. The
		  constitutive functions involved in the proposed model are
		  specified for a particular filled rubber on the basis of a
		  parameter identification process. The paper concludes with
		  some numerical examples which demonstrate the overall
		  response of the proposed model by means of a representative
		  set of numerical examples."

		  the firing threshold, whichever is less. The main result is
		  that for almost all initial conditions, the population
		  evolves to a state in which all the oscillators are firing
		  synchronously. The relationship between the model and real
		  communities of biological oscillators is discussed;
		  examples include populations of synchronously flashing
		  fireflies, crickets that chirp in unison, electrically
		  synchronous pacemaker cells, and groups of women whose
		  menstrual cycles become mutually synchronized.},

		  fact most materials are porous. This would then imply that
		  their properties depend on the density. In this report, we
		  develop a constitutive relation to describe the response of
		  elastic bodies that are linear in both the stress and the
		  linearized strain with the material moduli depending on the
		  density. Such a model is not possible within the context of
		  the classical theory of linearized elasticity but is
		  possible within the context of the implicit theory for
		  elastic bodies that has been developed. The constitutive
		  relations discussed in this paper can be useful to describe
		  the response of porous elastic bodies in the small
		  displacement gradient regime. Using these constitutive
		  relations, we study the stress concentration due to the
		  presence of a circular hole in a plate due to uniaxial
		  extension. We find that the stress concentration factor can
		  be significantly different from that in the case of the
		  classical linearized elastic solid.}

  abstract	= { Many researchers have asserted the importance of
		  considering the nonlinearity of the mechanical behavior of
		  asphalt binders for accurately estimating their performance
		  under field conditions, and for comparing and ranking them
		  accordingly. To do so, it is necessary to have a robust and
		  reliable nonlinear viscoelastic theory and a model derived
		  under its purview that can describe the mechanical response
		  of asphalt binders reasonably well. The objective of this
		  study is to develop such a model. A new
		  Gibbs-potential–based thermodynamic framework is used for
		  this purpose. The model developed in this paper is a
		  generalization of the Oldroyd-B model. It is used
		  successfully to describe results of several experiments
		  from the literature concerning the nonlinear response of
		  asphalt binders, including nonlinear creep-recovery and
		  stress-relaxation behavior, thinning behavior, and the
		  appearance of normal forces perpendicular to the plane of
		  shear in simple shear tests.}

		  It presents a systematic exposition of several aspects of
		  differential calculus in normed or topological linear
		  spaces and highlights various settings in nonlinear
		  functional analysis in which differentials play an
		  important role. Differential splays at least three
		  significant roles in the theory and application of
		  nonlinear functional analysis. The first and the most
		  familiar role is that of local approximation of a nonlinear
		  map by a linear one. The differential is also important as
		  a tool in nonlinear functional analysis. The third role of
		  the differential is in the clue it provides for
		  generalizations of a certain class of differentiable
		  operators. The theory of differentiation in linear
		  topological spaces is fairly complete for practical
		  purpose. "

  abstract	= { An introduction to both automatic differentiation and
		  object-oriented programming can enrich a numerical analysis
		  course that typically incorporates numerical
		  differentiation and basic MATLAB computation. Automatic
		  differentiation consists of exact algorithms on
		  floating-point arguments. This implementation overloads
		  standard elementary operators and functions in MATLAB with
		  a derivative rule in addition to the function value; for
		  example, \$\sin u\$ will also compute \$(\cos u)\ast
		  u^{\prime}\$, where u and \$u^{\prime }\$ are numerical
		  values. These methods are mostly one-line programs that
		  operate on a class of value-and-derivative objects,
		  providing a simple example of object-oriented programming
		  in MATLAB using the new (as of release 2008a) class
		  definition structure. The resulting powerful tool computes
		  derivative values and multivariable gradients, and is
		  applied to Newton's method for root-finding in both single
		  and multivariable settings. To compute higher-order
		  derivatives of a single-variable function, another class of
		  series objects keeps Taylor polynomial coefficients up to
		  some order. Overloading multiplication on series objects is
		  a combination (discrete convolution) of coefficients. This
		  idea leads to algorithms for other operations and functions
		  on series objects. A survey of more advanced topics in
		  automatic differentiation includes an introduction to the
		  reverse mode (our implementation is forward mode) and
		  considerations in arbitrary-order multivariable series computation. }

		  loaded into the plastic regime they often exhibit
		  deformations that are localized into small regions at some
		  point in the loading process. This intense localized
		  deformation limits the formability of materials and will
		  often quickly lead to failure with continued loading.
		  Localized deformation is often associated with satisfaction
		  of the classical discontinuous bifurcation criterion. Here
		  we propose that the loss of strong ellipticity criterion
		  should be used in place of the classical discontinuous
		  bifurcation criterion as a necessary condition for
		  localization. The application of the strong ellipticity
		  criterion implies that a bifurcation mode associated with
		  loss of positive definiteness of the symmetric part of the
		  acoustic tensor must be identified rather than a mode
		  associated with the first zero eigenvalue of the acoustic
		  tensor itself. The eigensystem for the symmetric part of
		  the tangent modulus tensor is obtained for several
		  different plasticity models. This eigensystem provides
		  information about deformation modes associated with both
		  diffuse and discontinuous bifurcations. Material
		  properties, boundary conditions and body geometry are all
		  shown to affect the diffuse and localized deformation modes
		  that are generated. Numerous experimental observations of
		  necking and localization in metal specimens subject to
		  various boundary conditions are explained with the proposed
		  approach."

  abstract	= { Many attempts have been made to reproduce theoretically
		  the stress–strain curves obtained from experiments on the
		  isothermal deformation of highly elastic ‘rubberlike'
		  materials. The existence of a strain-energy function has
		  usually been postulated, and the simplifications
		  appropriate to the assumptions of isotropy and
		  incompressibility have been exploited. However, the usual
		  practice of writing the strain energy as a function of two
		  independent strain invariants has, in general, the effect
		  of complicating the associated mathematical analysis (this
		  is particularly evident in relation to the calculation of
		  instantaneous moduli of elasticity) and, consequently, the
		  basic elegance and simplicity of isotropic elasticity is
		  sacrificed. Furthermore, recently proposed special forms of
		  the strain-energy function are rather complicated functions
		  of two invariants. The purpose of this paper is, while
		  making full use of the inherent simplicity of isotropic
		  elasticity, to construct a strain-energy function which:
		  (i) provides an adequate representation of the mechanical
		  response of rubberlike solids, and (ii) is simple enough to
		  be amenable to mathematical analysis. A strain-energy
		  function which is a linear combination of strain invariants
		  defined by ϕ(α) = (a1α+a2α+a3α–3)/α is proposed;
		  and the principal stretches a1, a2 and a3 are used as
		  independent variables subject to the incompressibility
		  constraint a1a2 a3 = 1. Principal axes techniques are used
		  where appropriate. An excellent agreement between this
		  theory and the experimental data from simple tension, pure
		  shear and equibiaxial tension tests is demonstrated. It is
		  also shown that the present theory has certain
		  repercussions in respect of the constitutive inequality
		  proposed by Hill (1968a, 1970b). }

  abstract	= {The morphology of porous anodic oxide films formed on
		  aluminium in phosphoric acid electrolytes at constant
		  current density or voltage, and under changing electrical
		  or electrolytic conditions, has been studied quantitatively
		  by electron microscopy. Replicas from film sections and
		  from both film interfaces have been prepared, as well as
		  transmission micrographs of thin films, produced under
		  accurately defined conditions. During formation at constant
		  current density, pore initiation occurs by the merging of
		  locally thickening oxide regions, which seem related to the
		  substructure of the substrate, and the consequent
		  concentration of current into the residual thin areas. The
		  pores grow in diameter and change in number until the
		  steady-state morphology is established. The film barrier
		  layer thickness has been measured directly for the first
		  time. The steady-state barrier-layer thickness, cell
		  diameter and pore diameter are all observed to be directly
		  proportional to the formation voltage. It becomes evident
		  that the barrier-layer thickness, decided largely by an
		  equilibrium established between oxide formation in the
		  barrier-layer and field-assisted dissolution (probably
		  thermally enhanced) at the pore bases, determines the cell
		  and pore sizes by a simple geometrical mechanism. Anion
		  incorporation into the film and its hydrogen-bonded
		  structure play secondary roles to these factors in
		  determining the actual film morphology, although not its
		  subsequent properties. A consequence of the mechanism is
		  that, at constant current density, relatively
		  non-aggressive electrolytes give thicker barrier layers,
		  larger cells and larger pores next to the barrier layer
		  than aggressive media, although subsequent pore widening at
		  the outer surface of the film by simple chemical
		  dissolution is more severe in aggressive electrolytes.},

  abstract	= {The aim of this paper is to compare a hyperelastic with a
		  hypoelastic model describing the Eulerian dynamics of
		  solids in the context of non-linear elastoplastic
		  deformations. Specifically, we consider the well-known
		  hypoelastic Wilkins model, which is compared against a
		  hyperelastic model based on the work of Godunov and
		  Romenski. First, we discuss some general conceptual
		  differences of the two approaches. Second, a detailed study
		  of both models is proposed, where differences are made
		  evident at the aid of deriving a hypoelastic-type model
		  corresponding to the hyperelastic model and a particular
		  equation of state used in this paper. Third, using the same
		  high order ADER Finite Volume and Discontinuous Galerkin
		  methods on fixed and moving unstructured meshes for both
		  models, a wide range of numerical benchmark test problems
		  has been solved. The numerical solutions obtained for the
		  two different models are directly compared with each other.
		  For small elastic deformations, the two models produce very
		  similar solutions that are close to each other. However, if
		  large elastic or elastoplastic deformations occur, the
		  solutions present larger differences.}

  abstract	= "We propose an innovative procedure by exploiting the
		  physical meaning of natural strain or Lode invariants with
		  the following salient contributions: 1) Uniaxial data for
		  human brain tissue is used to stipulate the mathematical
		  structure of the potential in terms of the Lode invariant
		  that quantifies the magnitude of distortion along with the
		  modulus term being an unknown function of the Lode angle
		  that quantifies the mode or type of distortion. 2) By a
		  priori analysis using the Baker-Ericksen inequalities, the
		  mathematical form of the modulus function is determined in
		  a novel manner. 3) The derived modulus function is
		  corrected by adding a constant, which in turn is determined
		  using analysis involving sufficient conditions of the
		  stronger Hill inequality. 4) In addition, we also prove
		  that any potential that satisfies Hill inequality also
		  satisfies true-stress-true-strain monotonicity condition in
		  plane stress. Compared to Mihai-Ogden model, besides
		  excellent quantitative agreement with data for human brain
		  tissue (see Mihai et al., 2017), the constructed model
		  also emulates the observed non-linear behavior of shear
		  stress with respect to the amount of shear as opposed to
		  the nearly linear response predicted by the antecedent
		  model. Additionally, when only tension-compression data is
		  available for determining material parameters, the
		  predicted combined tension and shear response associated
		  with the proposed constitutive relation shows monotone
		  decreasing Poynting stress (compressive), while the former
		  predicts an unexpected non-monotone response for certain
		  levels of tension."

  abstract	= {We investigate the classical problem of motion of a
		  mathematical pendulum with an oscillating pivot. This
		  simple mechanical setting is frequently used as the prime
		  example of a system exhibiting the parametric resonance
		  phenomenon, which manifests itself by surprising
		  stabilisation/destabilisation effects. In the classical
		  case the pivot oscillations are described by a cosine wave,
		  and the corresponding stability analysis requires one to
		  investigate the behaviour of solutions to the Mathieu
		  equation. This is not a straightforward procedure, and it
		  does not lead to exact and simple analytical results
		  expressed in terms of elementary functions. Consequently,
		  the explanation of the parametric resonance phenomenon can
		  be in this case obscured by the relatively involved
		  technical calculations. We show that the stability analysis
		  is much easier if one considers the pivot motion described
		  by a non-smooth function—a triangular or a nearly
		  rectangular wave. The non-smooth pivot motion leads to the
		  presence of singularities (Dirac distributions) in the
		  corresponding Mathieu type equation, which seemingly
		  further complicates the analysis. Fortunately, this is only
		  a minor technical difficulty. Once the mathematical setting
		  for the non-smooth forcing is settled down, the
		  corresponding stability diagram is indeed straightforward
		  to obtain, and the stability boundaries are, unlike in the
		  classical case, given in terms of simple analytical
		  formulae involving only elementary functions.}

		  and provides high accuracy and computational efficiency.
		  Accuracy and stability of the method are thoroughly tested
		  for the model problem of transitional and turbulent flows
		  in an infinite circular pipe. Verification of the algorithm
		  includes two issues. First, spectral characteristics of the
		  Hagen–Poiseuille flow stability problem are compared with
		  those of the discrete linearized Navier–Stokes operator.
		  Secondly, the results of direct Navier–Stokes simulation
		  of all stages of laminar-turbulent transition in a circular
		  pipe at Reynolds number of 4000 are presented. Time
		  evolution of finite-amplitude disturbances of laminar flow
		  was calculated until the statistically stationary turbulent
		  flow regime was established. In addition to common
		  statistical analysis, the possibility of turbulence
		  description by means of velocity fields having certain
		  symmetries is examined. Thus, the algorithm presented seems
		  to be a ready-to-use robust tool for accurate investigation
		  and further parametric studies of both transition
		  mechanisms and fully developed turbulent flow regimes. "

  abstract	= "We derive a representation formula for a class of solids
		  described by implicit constitutive relations between the
		  Cauchy stress tensor and the Hencky strain tensor. Using a
		  thermodynamic framework, we show that the Hencky strain
		  tensor can be obtained as the derivative of the specific
		  Gibbs free energy with respect to a stress tensor related
		  to the Cauchy stress tensor. Unlike previous studies that
		  have considered implicit relations between the Cauchy
		  stress tensor and the Hencky strain we work with quantities
		  that allow us to split the deformation into two parts. One
		  part is connected to deformations that change the volume
		  and the other to deformations where volume is preserved.
		  Such a decomposition allows us to clearly characterise the
		  interplay between the corresponding parts of the stress
		  tensor, and to identify additional restrictions regarding
		  the admissible formulae for the Gibbs free energy. We also
		  show that if the constitutive relations of this type are
		  linearised under the small strain assumption, then one can
		  transparently obtain linearised models with
		  density/pressure/stress dependent elastic moduli in a
		  natural manner."

		  a discussion of the thermodynamic underpinnings of such
		  models. We focus on the use of Gibbs free energy instead of

		  based on physical considerations, to describe the response
		  of elastic bodies, that captures all the characteristics
		  exhibited by the popular Blatz-Ko model, but in addition
		  presents some interesting novel features. The fact that the
		  Cauchy stress appears linearly in the implicit constitutive
		  relation between the stress and the left Cauchy–Green
		  strain with the material moduli depending nonlinearly on
		  the deformation gradient, allows us to capture several
		  characteristic features of the response of rubber-like
		  elastic solids. Interestingly, in the nonlinear implicit
		  model that we develop, we find that it is possible to have
		  the normal stress components of the stress influence the
		  shearing motion at second order, when considering weakly
		  nonlinear waves, that only occurs at third order within the
		  case of the classical nonlinear Cauchy elasticity theory.
		  Linearization of the constitutive relation under the
		  assumption of small displacement gradient reduces the
		  constitutive relation to one whose material moduli can
		  depend on the trace of the linearized strain and hence the
		  density in virtue of the balance of mass, such a feature is
		  not possible within the context of the Blatz-Ko
		  constitutive relation, or for that matter any Cauchy
		  elastic body, as linearization leads to the classical
		  linearized elastic constitutive relation that has constant
		  material moduli.}

		  inelastic response of materials. Part I (see Rajagopal and
		  Srinivasa, 1998 International Journal of Plasticity 14,
		  945–967) dealt with the structure of the constitutive
		  equations for the elastic response of a material with
		  multiple natural configurations. We now focus attention on
		  the evolution of the natural configurations. We introduce
		  two functions-the Helmholtz potential and the rate of
		  dissipation function—representing the rate of conversion
		  of mechanical work into heat. Motivated by, and
		  generalizing the work of Ziegler (1963) in Progress in
		  Solid Mechanics, Vol. 4, North-Holland, Amsterdam/New York;
		  (1983) An Introduction to Thermodynamics, North-Holland,
		  Amsterdam/New York) we then assume that the evolution of
		  the natural configurations occurs in such a way that the
		  rate of dissipation is maximized. This maximization is
		  subject to the constraint that the rate of dissipation is
		  equal to the difference between the rate of mechanical
		  working and the rate of increase of the Helmholtz potential
		  per unit volume. This then allows us to derive the
		  constitutive equations for the stress response and the
		  evolution of the natural configurations from these two
		  scalar functions. Of course, the maximum rate of
		  dissipation criterion that is stated here is only an
		  assumption that holds for a certain class of materials
		  under consideration. Our quest is to see whether such an
		  assumption gives reasonable results. In the process, we
		  hope to gain insight into the nature of such materials. We
		  demonstrate that the resulting constitutive equations allow
		  for response with and without yielding behavior and obtain
		  a generalization of the normality and convexity conditions.
		  We also show that, in the limit of quasistatic
		  deformations, if one considers materials that possess
		  yielding behavior, then the constitutive equations reduce
		  to those corresponding to the strain space formulation of
		  the rate independent theory of plasticity (see e.g. Naghdi
		  (1990) Journal of Applied Mathematics and Physics A345,
		  425–458.). Moreover, in this limit, the maximum rate of
		  dissipation criterion, as stated here, is equivalent to the
		  work inequality of Naghdi and Trapp (1975) Quartely Journal
		  of Mechanics and Applied Mathematics 28, 25–46). The main
		  results together with an illustrative example are
		  presented. "

		  relations that are developed allow the material moduli to
		  depend on the density; thus, they can be used to describe

		  usually described by means of statistical mechanics. In
		  particular, the Neo-Hooke model has been derived in this
		  fashion. The micromechanical modelling can be extended to
		  include also the breaking and reforming of chains. One
		  possible approach at this level is the so-called transient
		  network theory. Using certain assumptions for the chain
		  distributions, one arrives at a continuum mechanical model
		  of finite viscoelasticity which is based on the
		  multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient.
		  This means that the inelastic part of the deformation is
		  regarded as an elastic isomorphism. Further, the
		  considerations at the micro level give information about
		  the temperature dependence of the mechanical material
		  parameters. For instance, it can be shown easily that the
		  shear modulus depends approximately linearly on the
		  temperature. This fact has important consequences for
		  thermo-mechanical coupling which have not yet been
		  discussed in detail in the literature.}

		  a viscoelastic material with at least two different
		  relaxation mechanisms. In this paper we compare multi-mode
		  constitutive models combining two viscoelastic modes
		  (linear and/or nonlinear) in three possible ways. Our
		  particular choice of the two modes was inspired by models
		  originally developed to describe the response of asphalt
		  binders. We select the model that best fits the
		  experimental data obtained from a modified stress
		  relaxation experiment in the torsional configuration of the
		  plate–plate rheometer. The optimisation of the five model
		  parameters for each model is achieved by minimising the
		  weighted least-squares distance between experimental
		  observations and the computer model output using
		  a tree-structured Parzen estimator algorithm to find an
		  initial guess, followed by further optimisation using the
		  Nelder–Mead simplex algorithm. The results show that the
		  model combining the linear mode and the nonlinear mode is
		  the most suitable variant to describe the observed
		  behaviour of SBR in the given regime. The predictive
		  capabilities of the three models are further examined in
		  changed experimental and numerical configurations. Full
		  data and code to produce the figures in this article are
		  included as supplementary material."

  abstract	= {{Embryos of different species of vertebrate share a common
		  organisation and often look similar. Adult differences
		  among species become more apparent through divergence at
		  later stages. Some authors have suggested that members of
		  most or all vertebrate clades pass through a virtually
		  identical, conserved stage. This idea was promoted by
		  Haeckel, and has recently been revived in the context of
		  claims regarding the universality of developmental
		  mechanisms. Thus embryonic resemblance at the tailbud stage
		  has been linked with a conserved pattern of developmental
		  gene expression - the zootype. Haeckel's drawings of the
		  external morphology of various vertebrates remain the most
		  comprehensive comparative data purporting to show a
		  conserved stage. However, their accuracy has been
		  questioned and only a narrow range of species was
		  illustrated. In view of the current widespread interest in
		  evolutionary developmental tal biology, and especially in
		  the conservation of developmental mechanisms,
		  re-examination of the extent of variation in vertebrate
		  embryos is long overdue, We present here the first review
		  of the external morphology of tailbud embryos, illustrated
		  with original specimens from a wide range of vertebrate
		  groups, We find that embryos at the tailbud stage - thought
		  to correspond to a conserved stage - show variations in
		  form due to allometry, heterochrony, and differences in
		  body plan and somite number. These variations foreshadow
		  important differences in adult body form. Contrary to
		  recent claims that all vertebrate embryos pass through a
		  stage when they are the same size, we find a greater than
		  10-fold variation in greatest length at the tailbud stage.
		  Our survey seriously undermines the credibility of
		  Haeckel's drawings, which depict not a conserved stage for
		  vertebrates, but a stylised amniote embryo. In fact, the
		  taxonomic level of greatest resemblance among vertebrate
		  embryos is below the subphylum. The wide variation in
		  morphology among vertebrate embryos is difficult to
		  reconcile with the idea of a phyogenetically-conserved
		  tailbud stage, and suggests that at least some
		  developmental mechanisms are not highly constrained by the
		  zootype, Our study also highlights the dangers of drawing
		  general conclusions about vertebrate development from
		  studies of gene expression in a small number of laboratory
		  species.}},

		  This controversy has major implications for evolutionary

		  addressed the issue with his Biogenetic Law, and his embryo
		  drawings functioned as supporting data. We re-examine
		  Haeckel's work and its significance for modern efforts to
		  develop a rigorous comparative framework for developmental
		  studies. Haeckel's comparative embryology was evolutionary
		  but non-quantitative. It was based on developmental
		  sequences, and treated heterochrony as a sequence change.
		  It is not always clear whether he believed in
		  recapitulation of single characters or entire stages. The
		  Biogenetic Law is supported by several recent studies - if
		  applied to single characters only. Haeckel's important but
		  overlooked alphabetical analogy of evolution and
		  development is an advance on von Baer. Haeckel recognized
		  the evolutionary diversity in early embryonic stages, in
		  line with modern thinking. He did not necessarily advocate
		  the strict form of recapitulation and terminal addition
		  commonly attributed to him. Haeckel's much-criticized
		  embryo drawings are important as phylogenetic hypotheses,
		  teaching aids, and evidence for evolution. While some
		  criticisms of the drawings are legitimate, others are more
		  tendentious. In opposition to Haeckel and his embryo
		  drawings, Wilhelm His made major advances towards
		  developing a quantitative comparative embryology based on
		  morphometrics. Unfortunately His's work in this area is
		  largely forgotten. Despite his obvious flaws, Haeckel can

		  embryology. It is now important to be able to compare gene
		  expression in different species at similar developmental
		  stages. One phenomenon which may make it difficult to
		  compare embryos in this way is heterochrony-a change in
		  developmental timing during evolution. It is not clear
		  whether heterochrony can affect the intermediate stages of
		  embryonic development, when many important genes involved
		  in pattern formation are expressed. A prevalent view is
		  that these so-called phylotypic stages are resistant to
		  evolutionary change because they are when the body plan is
		  laid down. Haeckel's famous drawings, which show different
		  vertebrates developing from virtually identical
		  somite-stage embryos, are still used to support this idea.
		  I have reexamined the morphological data relating to
		  developmental timing in somite-stage embryos. The data
		  reveal striking patterns of heterochrony during vertebrate
		  evolution. These shifts in developmental timing have
		  strongly affected the phylotypic stage, which is therefore
		  poorly conserved and is more appropriately described as the
		  phylotypic period. This is contrary to the impression
		  created by Haeckel's drawings, which I show to be
		  inaccurate and misleading. The study of gene expression in
		  embryos which shown heterochrony could give important
		  insights into evolutionary and developmental mechanisms.

		  load-deformation curves obtained for certain simple types
		  of deformation of vulcanized rubber test-pieces in terms of

		  such a manner that one of the invariants of the strain, I1

		  material, under the action of three pairs of equal and
		  oppositely directed forces f1,f2,f3, applied normally to,
		  and uniformly distributed over, pairs of parallel faces of
		  the cube, is studied. It is assumed that the only possible
		  equilibrium states are states of pure, homogeneous
		  deformation. It is found that (1) when the stress
		  components in the deformed cube are specified, the
		  corresponding equilibrium state is uniquely determined
		  (this is shown in section 6 of Part I). (2) When the three
		  pairs of equal and oppositely directed forces f1,f2 and f3
		  are specified, (a) the corresponding equilibrium state is
		  uniquely determined, provided that one or more of the
		  forces f1,f2 and f3 is negative, i.e. is a compressional
		  force, or, if they are all positive, provided that f1f2f3 <
		  (1/3E)3, where 1/3E is the constant of proportionality
		  between the stress and strain components (analogous to the
		  rigidity modulus of the classical theory of small elastic
		  deformations of isotropic materials). (b) If f1,f2 and f3
		  are all positive and f1f2f3 > (1/3E)3, then the equilibrium
		  state is not necessarily uniquely determined. The number of
		  equilibrium states which exist depends on the values of
		  f1,f2,f3 and 1/3E. The actual state of deformation which is
		  obtained depends in general on the order in which the
		  forces are applied. In the cases (1) and (2a), it is shown
		  that the unique equilibrium state is one of stable
		  equilibrium. In case (2b), it is shown that the possible
		  equilibrium states are of eight different types. Two of
		  these are mutually exclusive. Of these eight types of
		  equilibrium state, four are inherently unstable. Of the
		  other four types, one is inherently stable. The three
		  remaining types of equilibrium state are not necessarily
		  unique; i.e. more than one equilibrium state of each type
		  may correspond to specified values of f1,f2 and f3.
		  However, if one or more equilibrium states of a particular
		  type exists, then at least one of them is stable. If f1 =
		  f2 = f3 = f, then there is a unique state of stable
		  equilibrium, provided that f < 1/3E. If 1/3E < f <
		  (1/4)1/3E, then there are three states of stable
		  equilibrium, none of which is identical with the undeformed
		  state of the cube. If (1/4)1/3E < f < 2/3E, there are four
		  states of stable equilibrium, one of which is identical
		  with the undeformed state of the cube. If f > 2/3E, then
		  there is only one state of stable equilibrium, and this is
		  identical with the undeformed state of the cube.},

		  distance from one end of the tube. Certain special cases of
		  this deformation are considered in greater detail employing
		  a simple stored-energy function of the form W =
		  C1(I1-3)+C2(I2-3), where C1 and C2 are physical constants
		  for the material and I1 and I2 are the strain invariants.
		  The second type of deformation considered is that in which
		  the simpler deformations (i) and (ii) mentioned above are
		  followed successively by simple shears about the axis of
		  the tube and parallel to it. The forces which must be
		  applied are calculated for the simple form of stored-energy
		  function given above. Finally, the simultaneous simple
		  flexure and uniform extension normal to the plane of
		  flexure of a thick sheet is discussed, and a number of the
		  results obtained in a previous paper (Rivlin 1949 b) are
		  generalized.},

  abstract	= {A cuboid of highly elastic incompressible material, whose
		  stored-energy function W is a function of the strain
		  invariants, has its edges parallel to the axes x, y and z
		  of a rectangular Cartesian co-ordinate system. It can be
		  bent so that: (i) every plane, initially normal to the
		  x-axis, becomes part of the curved surface of a cylinder
		  whose axis is the z-axis; (ii) every plane, initially
		  normal to the y-axis, becomes a plane containing the
		  z-axis; (iii) there is no displacement parallel to the
		  z-axis. It is found that such a state of flexure can be
		  maintained by the application of surface tractions only,
		  and these are calculated explicitly in terms of the
		  derivatives of W with respect to the strain invariants. The
		  surface tractions are normal to the surfaces on which they
		  act, in their deformed state. Those acting on the surfaces
		  initially normal to the x-axis are uniform over each of
		  these surfaces. The assumption is then made that the
		  stored-energy function W has the form, originally suggested
		  by Mooney (1940), for rubber, W = C$_{1}$($\lambda
		  _{1}^{2}$+$\lambda _{2}^{2}$+$\lambda
		  _{3}^{2}$-3)+C$_{2}$($\lambda _{2}^{2}\lambda
		  _{3}^{2}$+$\lambda _{3}^{2}\lambda _{1}^{2}$+$\lambda
		  _{1}^{2}\lambda _{2}^{2}$-3), where C$_{1}$ and C$_{2}$ are
		  physical constants for the material and $\lambda _{1}$,
		  $\lambda _{2}$, $\lambda _{3}$ are the principal extension
		  ratios. For this case-and therefore for the incompressible
		  neo-Hookean material (Rivlin 1948a, b, c), which is
		  obtained from this by putting C$_{2}$ = 0- it is found that
		  the flexure can be maintained without the application of
		  surface tractions to the curved surface, provided that
		  2(a$_{1}$ - a$_{2}$) (r$_{1}$r$_{2}$)$^{\frac{1}{2}}$ =
		  r$_{1}^{2}$ - r$_{2}^{2}$, where (a$_{1}$ - a$_{2}$) is the
		  initial dimension of the cuboid, parallel to the x-axis,
		  and r$_{1}$ and r$_{2}$ are the radii of the curved
		  surfaces. When this condition is satisfied, the system of
		  surface tractions applied to a boundary initially normal to
		  the y-axis is equivalent to a couple M, proportional to
		  (C$_{1}$ + C$_{2}$). It is also found that the surface
		  tractions applied to a boundary normal to the z-axis has a
		  resultant F$_{2}$ proportional to (C$_{1}$ - C$_{2}$).},

		  an isotropic inhomogeneous compressible annular right
		  circular cylinder. Current approaches to homogenization
		  that appeal to an equivalence in the stored energies could
		  lead to serious errors in the estimate for stresses in a
		  inhomogeneous body as stresses depend on the derivatives of
		  the stored energy with respect to the deformation gradient.
		  This is a serious drawback as many a time failures are
		  determined by the stresses. The study demonstrates that, in
		  particular, great caution should be exercised in
		  homogenization, especially if an inhomogeneous body is to
		  be approximated by a homogeneous body belonging to the same
		  class. Comparison of local measures, such as stresses,
		  reveal that their values in the case of the inhomogeneous
		  body and its homogeneous counterpart can be both
		  qualitatively and quantitatively far apart. Even the
		  differences in global measures like the axial load, torque,
		  etc., are found to be significant between the inhomogeneous
		  body and its homogeneous counterpart. It is also shown that
		  the material parameters characterizing the homogenous
		  approximation gleaned from correlations from different
		  experiments, performed on the same inhomogeneous body, can
		  be quite different. }

		  Navier-Stokes}schen Bewegungsgleichungen die
		  Str\"omungsdifferentialgleichung. Die Ermittlung der
		  Anfachung einer gegebenen St\"orung erweist sich als ein

  abstract	= { There are some materials in nature that experience
		  deformations that are not elastic. Viscoelastic materials
		  are some of them. We come across many such materials in our
		  daily lives through a number of interesting applications in
		  engineering, material science and medicine. This article
		  concerns itself with modelling of the nonlinear response of
		  a class of viscoelastic solids. In particular, nonlinear
		  viscoelasticity of strain rate type, which can be described
		  by a constitutive relation for the stress function
		  depending not only on the strain but also on the strain
		  rate, is considered. This particular case is not only
		  favourable from a mathematical analysis point of view but
		  also due to experimental observations, knowledge of the
		  strain rate sensitivity of viscoelastic properties is
		  crucial for accurate predictions of the mechanical
		  behaviour of solids in different areas of applications.
		  First, a brief introduction of some basic terminology and
		  preliminaries, including kinematics, material
		  frame-indifference and thermodynamics, is given. Then,
		  considering the governing equations with constitutive
		  relationships between the stress and the strain for the
		  modelling of nonlinear viscoelasticity of strain rate type,
		  the most general model of interest is obtained. Then, the
		  long-term behaviour of solutions is discussed. Finally,
		  some applications of the model are presented. }

  abstract	= "Classical invariants, despite that most of them have an
		  unclear physical interpretation and not having experimental
		  advantages, have been extensively used in modeling
		  nonlinear transversely isotropic soft tissue. In this
		  paper, a new set of spectral invariants that has some
		  advantages over classical invariants, is proposed to model
		  the behaviour of transversely isotropic soft tissue
		  materials. With the aid of the proposed spectral invariant
		  formulation, which is shown to be more general, it is
		  possible to study, in a much simpler manner, the effect of
		  different types of deformations on the response of the
		  material. The proposed strain energy function which
		  contains single variable principal stretch functions is
		  useful in facilitating an experiment to obtain a specific
		  constitutive equation for a particular type of materials.
		  The explicit appearance of the classical ground state
		  constants in the constitutive equation simplifies the
		  calculation for their admissible values. A crude specific
		  constitutive model is proposed for soft tissue and the
		  model fits reasonably well with existing simple shear,
		  biaxial and uniaxial experimental data and managed to
		  predict several sets of experimental data."

		  mechanics (Lagrangian description) or the route of fluid
		  mechanics (Eulerian description). The purpose of this
		  review is to highlight the relationship between the
		  theories of viscoelasticity and of elasticity, and to
		  leverage this connection in contemporary soft matter
		  problems. We review the principles governing models for
		  viscoelastic liquids, for example solutions of flexible
		  polymers. Such materials are characterized by a relaxation
		  time λ, over which stresses relax. We recall the
		  kinematics and elastic response of large deformations, and
		  show which polymer models do (and which do not) correspond
		  to a nonlinear elastic solid in the limit λ → ∞.
		  With this insight, we split the work done by elastic
		  stresses into reversible and dissipative parts, and
		  establish the general form of the conservation law for the
		  total energy. The elastic correspondence can offer an
		  insightful tool for a broad class of problems; as an
		  illustration, we show how the presence or absence of an
		  elastic limit determines the fate of an elastic thread
		  during capillary instability. }

		  of smart materials and have significant technological
		  applications ranging from biomedical devices to aerospace
		  technology. First generation SMP’s relied on changes in
		  temperature to fix the temporary shape and have been
		  studied quite extensively in the past. In the last few
		  years a new generation of SMP’s have been synthesized in
		  which the temporary shape is fixed by exposure to light at
		  specific wavelengths (typically in the Ultraviolet, UV,
		  range). Exposure to light at certain wavelengths causes
		  photosensitive molecules, which are grafted on the polymer
		  chains comprising the material, to form covalent bonds.
		  These bonds act as crosslinks and are responsible for the
		  temporary shape. On exposure to light at a different
		  wavelength these bonds cleave and the material returns to
		  its original shape. Our research focuses on modeling the
		  mechanics associated with such light activated shape memory
		  polymers (LASMP’s) undergoing complex deformations. The
		  modeling is done using a framework based on the theory of
		  multiple natural configurations taking into consideration
		  the different aspects of modeling this material, which
		  include developing a model for the original virgin network
		  and for the other networks with different stress-free
		  states, formed due to exposure to light. In addition to
		  this, we also model the initiation and the formation of the
		  light activated networks and the reverse transition
		  resulting in the dissolution of these networks. Anisotropy
		  in the mechanical response is also incorporated into the
		  model. The model is then used to simulate results for
		  specific boundary value problems, such as uni-axial
		  extension and inflation of a cylinder. "

		  conductive heat transfer in the ice shell. We find that
		  tidal heating is concentrated in a narrow low viscosity
		  zone near the base of the ice shell and along faults.
		  Outside the SPR, the thickness of this zone is about 1/10
		  of the local ice thickness and the associated volumetric
		  heating is ≲10−6 W/m3, corresponding to less than
		  1 GW of dissipated power. In the SPR, the tidal effects
		  are enhanced by the combined action of faults and ice shell
		  thinning. Although the volumetric heating in this
		  relatively small region may be larger than 10−4 W/m3,
		  the total heat production in this region does not exceed
		  1.1 GW. Our computations show that tidal heating in the

		  implying that Enceladus' heat engine is powered by
		  dissipation in the core or in the ocean."

		  Srinivasa, A.R. Int. J. Plasticity 14 (1998) 945;

		  quadratic yield surfaces and non-hardening behavior) of the
		  Prandtl–Reuss theory to finite deformations, (2) to
		  examine the consequences of using a physically plausible
		  criterion of maximum rate of mechanical dissipation, (3) to
		  examine the relationship of the resulting models to the
		  classical Prandtl–Reuss theory as well as other possible
		  formulations (specifically those that rely on the use of a

		  effect of finite elastic strains on the response of the
		  material subject to some simple homogenous deformations. By
		  considering the response under simple shear, it is shown
		  that the elastic-plastic counterpart of the well known

		  the top layer there is again the possibility for the layer

		  may initiate in either the lowest layer, the upmost layer,

		  convection may occur where convective movement in one layer
		  induces motion in an adjacent sublayer. In certain cases

		  display a very rapid increase which is much greater than

		  model for describing the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of
		  deep-seabed sediments. To quantify the nonlinear response,
		  shear rheological tests are carried out on deep-sea
		  sediments substitute at different shear rates. These
		  substitute samples are prepared by mixing bentonite with
		  water based on the in-situ vane shear strength of deep-sea
		  sediments. A compressible viscoelastic fluid model is
		  formulated based on the thermodynamic framework developed
		  by Rajagopal and Srinivasa (2000) to describe the
		  experimental response of bentonite–water mixture.
		  Experimental responses indicate that the effects of slip
		  are significant in the shear rheometry of bentonite–water
		  mixture. Hence a slip model is proposed, which relates the
		  shear stress to slip velocity at the wall and the imposed
		  shear rate values. The slip boundary conditions coupled
		  with the viscoelastic model is validated using experimental
		  data and is observed to be in good agreement. Further, the
		  influence of shear rate on interfacial slip has been
		  numerically analyzed and slip effects are found to be
		  significant in defining rheological behavior with
		  increasing shear rates."

		  introduction of a stress diffusive term into the classical
		  Oldroyd-B constitutive equation on the numerical stability
		  of time-dependent viscoelastic flow calculations. The
		  channel Poiseuille flow at Re ⪢ 1 and O(1) We is chosen
		  as a test problem. Through a linear stability analysis, we
		  demonstrate that the introduction of a small amount of
		  (dimensionless) diffusivity, typically of the order 10−3,
		  does not affect the critical eigenmodes of the viscoelastic
		  Orr-Sommerfeld problem appreciably. However, a diffusive
		  term of that magnitude is shown to have a significant
		  influence on the singular eigenmodes of the classical
		  Oldroyd-B model, associated with the continuum spectra. A
		  finite amplitude perturbation is constructed as a linear
		  superposition of the eigenvectors corresponding to the most
		  unstable eigenvalues of the problem. This is superimposed
		  on the steady Poiseuille flow solution to provide the
		  initial conditions for time-dependent simulations. The
		  numerical algorithm involves a fully spectral spatial
		  discretization and a semi-implicit second order integration
		  in time. For the Oldroyd-B fluid, depending on the
		  magnitude of the initial perturbation, numerical
		  instabilities set in at relatively short times while the
		  components of the conformation tensor increase
		  monotonically in magnitude with time. Introduction of a
		  diffusive term into this model is shown to stabilize the
		  calculations remarkably, and for a three-dimensional
		  simulation with Re = 5000 and We = 1, no instabilities were
		  observed even at very large times. The effect of the
		  magnitude of the diffusivity on the stability and the flow
		  dynamics is addressed through a direct comparison of the
		  results with those obtained for the Oldroyd-B model."

		  considering the localization of deformation and illustrate
		  it for the case of hyperelastic materials. The approach
		  overcomes one of the major shortcomings in constitutive
		  equations for solids admitting localization of deformation
		  at finite strains, i.e. their inability to provide
		  physically acceptable solutions to boundary value problems
		  in the post-localization range due to loss of ellipticity
		  of the governing equations. Specifically, strain-induced
		  localized deformation patterns are accounted for by adding
		  a second deformation gradient-dependent term to the
		  expression for the strain energy density. The modified
		  strain energy function leads to equilibrium equations which
		  remain always elliptic. Explicit solutions of these
		  equations can be found for certain classes of deformations.
		  They suggest not only the direction but also the width of
		  the deformation bands providing for the first time a
		  predictive unifying method for the study of pre- and
		  post-localization behavior. The results derived here are a
		  three-dimensional extension of certain one-dimensional
		  findings reported earlier by the second author for the
		  problem of simple shear.",

		  phenomenological models, able to accurately simulate
		  hysteretic phenomena in rate-independent mechanical systems
		  and materials, which requires only one history variable and
		  leads to the solution of a scalar equation for the
		  evaluation of the generalized force. Two specific instances
		  of the class, denominated Bilinear and Exponential Models,
		  are developed as an example to illustrate the peculiar
		  features of the formulation. The Bilinear Model, that is
		  one of the simplest hysteretic models which can be emanated
		  from the proposed class, is first described to clarify the
		  physical meaning of the quantities adopted in the
		  formulation. Specifically, the potentiality of the proposed
		  class is witnessed by the Exponential Model, able to
		  simulate more complex hysteretic behaviors of
		  rate-independent mechanical systems and materials
		  exhibiting either kinematic hardening or softening. The
		  accuracy and the computational efficiency of this last
		  model are assessed by carrying out nonlinear time history
		  analyses, for a single degree of freedom mechanical system
		  having a rate-independent kinematic hardening behavior,
		  subjected either to a harmonic or to a random force. The
		  relevant results are compared with those obtained by
		  exploiting the widely used Bouc--Wen Model.",

		  (IR-DIC) for realizing simultaneous assessment of
		  Lagrangian strain and temperature fields. A major
		  difficulty in the IR-DIC is the evolution of the thermal
		  field during deformation that is unexpected in the image
		  correlation. Two solutions are proposed to tackle this
		  difficulty. The first solution is to utilize a high-pass
		  filter to eliminate the variation part of the thermal
		  signal, and the second solution is to employ an advanced
		  metric, the mutual information, as the correlation
		  criterion. Both methods are verified through a tensile test
		  performed on a notched specimen. The estimated displacement
		  and strain fields demonstrate well the desirable
		  performance of the proposed methods. Thanks to the
		  kinematic field assessment, the obtained thermal fields can
		  be described in the Lagrangian coordinate system, thus the
		  temperature evolution of the material points during
		  deformation can be followed effectively."

  abstract	= "According to the classical hypoelasticity theory, the
		  hypoelasticity tensor, i.e. the fourth order Eulerian
		  constitutive tensor, characterizing the linear relationship
		  between the stretching and an objective stress rate, is
		  dependent on the current stress and must be isotropic.
		  Although the classical hypoelasticity in this sense
		  includes as a particular case the isotropic elasticity, it
		  fails to incorporate any given type of anisotropic
		  elasticity. This implies that one can formulate the
		  isotropic elasticity as an integrable-exactly classical
		  hypoelastic relation, whereas one can in no way do the same
		  for any given type of anisotropic elasticity. A
		  generalization of classical theory is available, which
		  assumes that the material time derivative of the rotated
		  stress is dependent on the rotated Cauchy stress, the
		  rotated stretching and a Lagrangean spin, linear and of the
		  first degree in the latter two. As compared with the
		  original idea of classical hypoelasticity, perhaps the
		  just-mentioned generalization might be somewhat drastic. In
		  this article, we show that, merely replacing the isotropy
		  property of the aforementioned stress-dependent
		  hypoelasticity tensor with the invariance property of the
		  latter under an R-rotating material symmetry group R⋆G0,
		  one may establish a natural generalization of classical
		  theory, which includes all of elasticity. Here R is the
		  rotation tensor in the polar decomposition of the
		  deformation gradient and G0 any given initial material
		  symmetry group. In particular, the classical case is
		  recovered whenever the material symmetry is assumed to be
		  isotropic. With the new generalization it is demonstrated
		  that any two non-integrable hypoelastic relations based on
		  any two objective stress rates predict quite different
		  path-dependent responses in nature and hence can in no
		  sense be equivalent. Thus, the non-integrable hypoelastic
		  relations based on any given objective stress rate
		  constitute an independent constitutive class in its own
		  right which is disjoint with and hence distinguishes itself
		  from any class based on another objective stress rate. Only
		  for elasticity, equivalent hypoelastic formulations based
		  on different stress rates may be established. Moreover,
		  universal integrability conditions are derived for all
		  kinds of objective corotational stress rates and for all
		  types of material symmetry. Explicit, simple,
		  integrable-exactly hypoelastic relations based on the newly
		  discovered logarithmic stress rate are presented to
		  characterize hyperelasticity with any given type of
		  material symmetry. It is shown that, to achieve the latter
		  goal, the logarithmic stress rate is the only choice among
		  all infinitely many objective corotational stress rates.",

		  this work, we investigate the deformation behavior of two
		  engineering rubbers (EPDM and Silicone rubbers) until

		  used to capture the strain field of rubber specimens with
		  different types of geometry defects. The results show that

		  both rubbers a homogenous deformation behavior can be

		  defects. Finite element analysis (FEA) is also performed.
		  The Arruda-Boyce eight chain model is used to represent the
		  constitutive relationship of both rubbers with the
		  parameters determined from the stress-strain response of
		  specimens without geometry defects. The strain field
		  obtained from FEA shows good agreement with the
		  experimental data even in the large strain region close to
		  failure. However, the simulated force-displacement is
		  consistent with the experimental results only for specimens
		  without geometry defects. For specimens with geometry
		  defects, discrepancies exist in all the cases, which
