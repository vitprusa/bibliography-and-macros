		  caused by the temperature gradient appearing between the

		  place inside the glass in addition to the conductive heat
		  transfer. In this paper, we implemented 1-D
		  thermomechanical models using different methods for the
		  computation of the radiative effects inside the glass:
		  Rosseland approximation, P1 approximation and back ray
		  tracing. Thermal and residual stresses results are compared
		  to experimental results available in the literature to
		  investigate the effects of the different methods on the
		  heat transfer and mechanical behavior. We found that P1
		  approximation and back ray tracing are in good agreement
		  with the experimental results. Finally, a numerical
		  investigation is done by changing different parameters for
		  which the experimental results are not available.},

		  stress, the Bingham number Bn, on the heat transfer and
		  motion is investigated in the range 5.103<Ra<105 for the
		  Rayleigh number and Pr=10,100,1000 for the Prandtl number.
		  One shows that the yield stress has a stabilizing effect,
		  reducing the convection intensity. Above a certain value of
		  Bnmax, the convection does not occur and the heat transfer
		  is only due to conduction. For moderate Bn values, truly
		  unyielded regions are located in the center of the cavity;
		  their areas grow with increasing Bingham number and invade
		  the whole cavity at the threshold value Bnmax."

		  introduce a damage parameter, which might be a scalar,
		  vector or tensor, that depends on the stress or strain
		  (that requires knowledge of an appropriate reference
		  configuration in which the body was stress free and/or
		  without any strain), we exploit knowledge of the fact that
		  damage is invariably a consequence of the inhomogeneity of
		  the body that makes the body locally ‘weak’ and the
		  fact that the material properties of a body invariably
		  depend on the density, among other variables that can be
		  defined in the current configuration, of the body. This
		  allows us to use density, for a class of polymeric
		  materials, as a means to identify incipient damage in the
		  body. The calculations that are carried out for the biaxial
		  stretch of an inhomogeneous multi-network polymeric solid
		  bears out the appropriateness of the thesis that the
		  density of the body can be used to forecast the occurrence
		  of damage, with the predictions of the theory agreeing well
		  with experimental results. The study also suggests a
		  meaningful damage criterion for the class of bodies being
		  considered. }

		  on damage that consider the body to be homogeneous, with
		  initiation of damage being decided by parameters that are
		  based on a quantity such as the strain, that requires
		  information concerning a special reference configuration,
		  or the use of ad hoc parameters that have no physically
		  meaningful origins, in this study we use a physically
		  relevant parameter that is completely determined in the
		  current deformed state of the body to predict the
		  initiation of damage. Damage is initiated due to the
		  inhomogeneity of the body wherein certain regions in the
		  body are unable to withstand the stresses, strains, etc.
		  The specific inhomogeneity that is considered is the
		  variation of the density in the body. We consider damage

		  potential to transform the use of IR imaging for condition

		  integrated into the system for real-time, on-board data

		  principles of thermoelastic stress analysis (TSA).
		  Proof-of-concept laboratory tests were performed on
		  open-hole aluminium specimens to compare the performance of
		  the proposed system against a state-of-the-art cooled IR
		  photovoltaic effect detector. It was demonstrated that

  abstract	= { Liquid crystal elastomers exhibit stress softening with

		  phenomenon by generalizing the classical pseudo-elastic
		  formulation of the Mullins effect in rubber. Specifically,
		  we modify the neoclassical strain-energy density of liquid
		  crystal elastomers, depending on the deformation and the
		  nematic director, by incorporating two continuous variables
		  that account for stress softening and the associated set
		  strain. As the material behaviour is governed by different
		  forms of the strain-energy density on loading and
		  unloading, the model is referred to as pseudo-anelastic. We
		  then analyse qualitatively the mechanical responses of the
		  material under cyclic uniaxial tension, which is easier to
		  reproduce in practice, and further specialize the model in
		  order to calibrate its parameters to recent experimental
		  data at different temperatures. The excellent agreement
		  between the numerical and experimental results confirms the
		  suitability of our approach. Since the pseudo-energy
		  function is controlled by the strain-energy density for the
		  primary deformation, it is valid also for materials under
		  multiaxial loads. Our study is relevant to mechanical
		  damping applications and serves as a motivation for further
		  experimental tests. }

		  inelastic features in elastomers’ mechanical behaviour
		  such as the Mullins effect, the permanent set and the
		  induced anisotropy. While based on the pseudo-elasticity
		  theory, our model departs from the classical theory on
		  three counts: (i) a separable damage parameter Ω,
		  separable in the principal stretches, is devised and
		  incorporated to facilitate capturing the induced
		  anisotropy; (ii) the damage variable is directly
		  incorporated into the hyperelastic strain energy function
		  to capture the permanent set, and (iii) a specific
		  functional form for the damage parameter is considered,
		  conducive to modelling the foregoing behaviours. The
		  devised framework is then specialised using a recently
		  proposed strain energy function W (Anssari-Benam, 2023) and
		  is validated against various experimental datasets ranging
		  from filled natural and silicon rubbers, to synthetic
		  rubbers and hydrogels. It is shown that the proposed model
		  favourably captures the inelastic behaviours of interest
		  exhibited by the specimens, and the devised modelling
		  framework facilitates obtaining those favourable fits via a
		  reduced number of model parameters compared with the
		  existing theories in the literature. The proposed framework
		  may also be used directly in conjunction with other strain
		  energy functions for a versatile modelling of the Mullins
		  effect in the finite deformation of rubber-like
		  materials.}

  abstract	= "{Double and triple network (TN) elastomers can be made by
		  infusing monomers into a single network (SN) polymer,
		  causing it to swell, and then polymerizing and
		  cross-linking the monomers. The result is a double network
		  (DN) elastomer in which one network is stretched and the
		  other is in hydrostatic compression. TN systems are made by
		  repeating the process starting with the DN material. The
		  multinetwork (MN) elastomers exhibit a Mullins effect in
		  which softening occurs upon a first cycle of loading, with
		  the elastomer stiffness recovered above the previous
		  maximum strain. The Mullins effect is attributed to rupture
		  of the stretched network, eliminating the constraint on the
		  compressed network, thereby motivating straining at the
		  lower stiffness of the remaining material. A model for this
		  process is developed, based on the previous work of Horgan
		  et al. (2004, “A Theory of Stress Softening of Elastomers
		  Based on Finite Chain Extensibility,” Proc. R. Soc. A,
		  460(2046), pp. 1737–1754). In the proposed model, a
		  composite stiffness for the MN system is developed and a
		  damage process introduced to degrade the contribution of
		  the stretched network. The damage model is designed to
		  account for the progressive elimination of chains that are
		  most highly loaded in the stretched network, so that the
		  undamaged stiffness is restored when the strain rises above
		  levels previously experienced. The proposed model
		  reproduces the behavior of the Mullins effect in the MN
		  system.}",

		  a general class of coupled bead–spring chain models that
		  arise from the kinetic theory of dilute solutions of
		  nonhomogeneous polymeric liquids with noninteracting
		  polymer chains, with finitely extensible nonlinear elastic
		  (FENE) spring potentials. The class of models under
		  consideration involves the unsteady incompressible
		  Navier–Stokes equations with variable density and
		  density-dependent dynamic viscosity in a bounded domain in
		  Rd, d=2 or 3, for the density, the velocity and the
		  pressure of the fluid, with an elastic extra-stress tensor
		  appearing on the right-hand side in the momentum equation.
		  The extra-stress tensor stems from the random movement of
		  the polymer chains and is defined by the Kramers expression
		  through the associated probability density function that
		  satisfies a Fokker–Planck-type parabolic equation, a
		  crucial feature of which is the presence of a

		  the Fokker–Planck equation, which has finite relative
		  entropy with respect to the Maxwellian M associated with
		  the spring potential in the model, we prove, via a limiting
		  procedure on certain regularization parameters, the

		  t↦(ρ(t),u˜(t),ψ(t)) to the coupled
		  Navier–Stokes–Fokker–Planck system, satisfying the
		  initial condition (ρ(0),u˜(0),ψ(0))=(ρ0,u˜0,ψ0), such
		  that t↦ρ(t)∈[ρmin,ρmax], t↦u˜(t) belongs to the
		  classical Leray space and t↦ψ(t) has bounded relative
		  entropy with respect to M and t↦ψ(t)/M has integrable

  abstract	= {A general theory of isotropic stress-softening in
		  incompressible isotropic materials is developed. The
		  principal idea is that a stress-softening material is an
		  inelastic material that has selective memory of only the
		  maximum previous deformation to which it is subjected. This
		  memory dependence is incorporated within general material
		  response functions that are monotone decreasing functions
		  of a stress-softening variable, which is a monotone
		  increasing function of the maximum previous strain
		  experienced by the material. A loading criterion is
		  introduced to identify when the material is loaded along
		  its virgin deformation path where the maximum previous
		  strain is its current value, and to identify when it is
		  unloaded to deform subsequently as an ideal isotropic
		  elastic material in both elastic loading and unloading, so
		  long as the maximum previous strain is not exceeded. The
		  effect of loading from a configuration of maximum previous
		  strain is to further stress-soften the material. Results
		  demonstrating the effects of stress-softening are obtained
		  for general isotropic stress-softening materials in simple
		  uniaxial extension and in simple shear. A simplified
		  analytical model together with a special softening function
		  are introduced to illustrate some general results and to
		  provide specific analytical and graphical examples. Both
		  general and model-specific analytical results obtained for
		  simple uniaxial extension are shown to be consistent with
		  the overall ideal phenomenological behavior exhibited in
		  experiments by others on stress-softening in simple tension
		  and compression. Similar but totally new results for simple
		  shear are derived, and their relation to effects in simple
		  tension are discussed. It is demonstrated that the larger
		  effect of softening occurs in the simple uniaxial
		  extension, the effect in even a gross equivalent simple
		  shear being small. All results are obtained from general
		  three-dimensional constitutive equations.}

		  backscatter diffraction, atomic force microscopy and

		  the deformation in the TNTZ-O alloy is only accommodated by
		  dislocation slip. Thus, the addition of oxygen suppresses
		  the formation of α″ martensite and prevents the twinning
		  deformation mechanism, which were both observed in the TNTZ
		  alloy. In addition, in situ tensile tests in a transmission
		  electron microscope showed that conventional a/2〈111〉
		  dislocation slip occurs widely in the TNTZ-O alloy. Screw
		  dislocations have a lower mobility than non-screw
		  dislocations. Cross-slip is shown to be easy and
		  multiplication of dislocations by a double cross-slip
		  mechanism occurs extensively, leading to the formation of
		  large slip bands.}

		  methods are used to solve the resulting system. Neutral
		  curves for an extensive range of plate separations are
		  obtained, and, when the plate separation is large compared
		  to the Stokes layer thickness, the linear stability
		  properties of the Stokes layer in a semi-infinite fluid are
		  recovered. A detailed analysis of the damping rates of
		  disturbances to the basic flow provides a plausible
		  explanation of why several previous studies of the problem
		  have failed to detect any linear instability of the flow.
		  
		  To compare more faithfully with experimental work, the
		  techniques used for the channel problem are modified to
		  allow the determination of neutral curves for axisymmetric
		  disturbances to purely oscillatory flow in a circular pipe.
		  Critical Reynolds numbers for the pipe flow tend to be
		  smaller than their counterparts for the channel case, but
		  the smallest critical value is still almost twice the
		  experimentally reported result.}",

  abstract	= "Thermodynamical considerations have largely been avoided
		  in the modelling of complex fluids by invoking the
		  assumption of incompressibility. This approximation allows
		  pressure to be defined as a Lagrange multiplier, and
		  therefore its natural connection with other thermodynamic
		  variables such as density and temperature is irretrievably
		  lost. Relaxing this condition to allow more realistic
		  modelling involves much more than prescribing an equation
		  of state. Even for a simple isothermal viscoelastic model,
		  as explored in this paper, the transition to a compressible
		  model is non-trivial. This paper shows that pressure enters
		  the governing equations in a non-intuitive way.
		  Furthermore, a fluid volume element, which is no longer
		  constant, radically changes the way the basic element of
		  the constitutive equations is viewed---stress is no longer
		  the fundamental constitutive link between the momentum
		  equations and velocity. The importance of geometry in fluid
		  modelling is emphasised through the use of the Lie
		  derivative, which is of a more fundamental character than
		  the ``upper'' and ``lower'' convected derivatives prevalent
		  in the literature and which are found to be almost
		  redundant for a compressible fluid. There is now a strong
		  body of non-equilibrium thermodynamics theory for flowing
		  systems, which proves indispensible for this development.
		  These fundamental principles are described herein using
		  methodology and examples, that are sometimes conflicting,
		  from the literature. The main conflict arises from the
		  relationship between thermodynamic pressure and the trace
		  of Cauchy stress, where the current preferred choice is (up
		  to a constant) to set them equal---this is shown to be
		  incorrect. Other issues such as the dependence of viscosity
		  on density, bulk viscosity, integral modelling, the
		  principle of objectivity and convected derivatives, are
		  also clarified and resolved.",

		  diffuse interface methods, system evolution is driven by
		  the minimisation of a free energy. The originality of our
		  approach, derived from the Cahn--Hilliard model, comes from
		  the particular form of energy we proposed in Boyer and
		  Lapuerta (M2AN Math Model Numer Anal, 40:653--987,2006),
		  which, among other interesting properties, ensures
		  consistency with the two-phase model. The modelling of
		  three-phase flows is further completed by coupling the
		  Cahn--Hilliard system and the Navier--Stokes equations
		  where surface tensions are taken into account through
		  volume capillary forces. These equations are discretized in
		  time and space paying attention to the fact that most of
		  the main properties of the original model (volume
		  conservation and energy estimate) have to be maintained at
		  the discrete level. An adaptive refinement method is
		  finally used to obtain an accurate resolution of very thin
		  moving internal layers, while limiting the total number of
		  cells in the grids all along the simulation. Different
		  numerical results are given, from the validation case of
		  the lens spreading between two phases (contact angles and
		  pressure jumps), to the study of mass transfer through a
		  liquid/liquid interface crossed by a single rising gas
		  bubble. The numerical applications are performed with large

		  are not constant but increase with increasing minor
		  principal stress. The use of classical constant modulus
		  linear elasticity in these cases can lead to erroneous
		  predictions of the deformations and of the initiation and
		  extent of failure around underground excavations. To
		  illustrate these effects, solutions are developed for
		  axisymmetric excavations in infinite media having power law
		  and exponential variations of elastic modulus with minor
		  principal stress. The maximum stress concentrations do not
		  occur at the excavation boundaries and are less than the
		  constant value of 2.0 given by constant modulus elasticity.
		  When modified slightly to allow for test boundary
		  conditions, the theory gives predictions that are
		  consistent with aspects of the results obtained in
		  hydrostatic compression tests on thick walled cylinders of
		  three sedimentary rocks.",

		  construction of physically motivated Lyapunov functionals
		  for nonlinear stability analysis of spatially homogeneous
		  equilibrium states in thermodynamically isolated systems.
		  Unfortunately, the limitation to isolated systems is
		  essential, and standard arguments are not applicable even
		  for some very simple thermodynamically open systems. On the
		  other hand, the nonlinear stability of thermodynamically
		  open systems is usually investigated using the so-called
		  energy method. The mathematical quantity that is referred
		  to as the &ldquo;energy&rdquo; is, however, in most cases
		  not linked to the energy in the physical sense of the word.
		  Consequently, it would seem that genuine thermo-dynamical
		  concepts are of no use in the nonlinear stability analysis
		  of thermodynamically open systems. We show that this is not
		  the case. In particular, we propose a construction that in
		  the case of a simple heat conduction problem leads to a
		  physically well-motivated Lyapunov type functional, which
		  effectively replaces the artificial Lyapunov functional
		  used in the standard energy method. The proposed
		  construction seems to be general enough to be applied in
		  complex thermomechanical settings.},

		  Nonlinear behavior},
  abstract	= {Elastomers are characterized by their ability to undergo
		  large elastic deformation. Nevertheless, their behavior
		  exhibits stress softening, hysteresis and cyclic softening.
		  The first phenomenon, known as Mullins effect, is commonly
		  assumed to be either the result of an evolution in the hard
		  and soft domain microstructure whereby the effective volume
		  fraction of the soft domain increases with stretch or the
		  result of irreversible damage in the material or
		  combination of both. Hysteresis and cyclic stress softening
		  are often considered as the result of the effect of stress
		  relaxation. Based on the physical structure of filled
		  elastomers, the present study shows that the Mullins
		  effect, hysteresis and cyclic softening can be modeled by
		  dissipative friction phenomena due to internal sliding of
		  the macromolecular chains and to sliding of the connecting
		  chains on the reinforcing filler particles. This implies
		  that the three effects are in fact related to one single
		  deformation process. The proposed analysis allows to
		  identify the state variables and to build a thermodynamic
		  potential which accounts for the nonlinearity of the
		  material behavior and for a time independent hysteresis.
		  The constitutive model is 3D. Written in a rate form it
		  applies to complex loadings: monotonic, cyclic, random
		  fatigue, etc. Filled elastomers hysteresis loops and cyclic
		  softening are represented with no need to introduce neither
		  damage nor viscosity. The model was implemented in a Finite
		  Element software to simulate a metal/elastomer lap joint.
		  Good agreement with experiment was achieved.}

		  mathematical model is based on an existing macroscopic
		  phenomenological model by (Sodhi & Rao 2010, Int. J. Eng.

		  describe full three-dimensional deformation of light

		  modified for the reduced representation of origami-like
		  structures which is based on the bar-and-hinge approach.
		  The numerical solution of the corresponding governing

		  Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) to describe the Mullins
		  effect in elastomers. Thermodynamics of rubber-like
		  hyperelastic materials with isotropic damage is considered.
		  Since it is demonstrated that stress-softening is not
		  strictly speaking a damage phenomenon, the limitations of
		  the CDM approach are highlighted. Moreover, connections
		  with two-network-based constitutive models proposed by
		  other authors are exhibited through the choice of both the
		  damage criterion and the measure of deformation.
		  Experimental data are used to establish the evolution
		  equation of the stress-softening variable, and the choice
		  of the maximum deformation endured previously by the
		  material as the damage criterion is revealed as
		  questionable. Nevertheless, the present model agrees
		  qualitatively well with experiments except to reproduce the
		  strain-hardening phenomenon that takes place as reloading
		  paths rejoin the primary loading path. Finally, the
		  numerical implementation highlights the influence of
		  loading paths on material response and thereby demonstrates
		  the importance of considering the Mullins effect in
		  industrial design.}

  abstract	= {The environmental and economic concerns have raised the
		  popularity of biodiesel as a potential replacement for
		  conventional fuel. However, the incompatibility of
		  engineering rubber components with biodiesel affects
		  significantly the performance of the components. Majority
		  of the compatibility studies focus on evaluating the
		  degradation of mechanical properties of the rubbers due to
		  contamination of different types of biodiesel.
		  Nevertheless, the resulting mechanical responses of swollen
		  rubbers, in particularly under cyclic and fatigue loading
		  conditions, are rarely investigated. In engineering
		  applications where elastomeric components are concurrently
		  subjected to fluctuating mechanical loading and
		  contamination of hostile liquids such as biodiesel, it is
		  crucial to investigate the mechanical responses of these
		  components for durability analysis. In this view, the
		  present study aims to investigate the effect of swelling,
		  due to biodiesel diffusion in the elastomers, on the
		  macroscopic mechanical responses under cyclic loading
		  conditions. Simple stress-free immersion tests are
		  conducted on elastomers and the resulting mechanical
		  responses are evaluated. The focus of the present work is
		  on the effect of biodiesel diffusion on the inelastic
		  responses classically observed in elastomers under cyclic
		  loading conditions, i.e. stress-softening, hysteresis and
		  stress relaxation. The results show that the above
		  inelastic responses decrease significantly when the
		  swelling level increases.}

  abstract	= {We consider a fluid crossing a zone of rapid density
		  change, so thin that it can be considered as a density jump
		  interface. In this case, the normal velocity undergoes a
		  jump. For a Newtonian viscous fluid with low Reynolds
		  number (creeping flow) that keeps its rheological
		  properties within the interface, we show that this implies
		  that the traction cannot be continuous across the density
		  jump because the tangential stress is singular. The
		  appropriate jump conditions are established by using the
		  calculus of distributions, taking into account the
		  curvature of the interface as well as the density and
		  viscosity changes. Independently of any intrinsic surface
		  tension, a dynamic surface tension appears and turns out to
		  be proportional to the mass transfer across the interface
		  and to a coefficient related to the variations of density
		  and viscosity within the interface. Explicit solutions are
		  exhibited to illustrate the importance of these new jump
		  conditions. The example of the Earth's inner core
		  crystallisation is questioned.}

		  method of constitutive parameters is developed from full
		  kinematic and thermal field measurements. It consists in
		  reconstructing the heat source field from two different
		  approaches by using the heat diffusion equation. The first
		  one requires the temperature field measurement and the
		  value of the thermophysical parameters. The second one is
		  based on the kinematic field measurement and the choice of
		  a thermo-hyperelastic model that contains the parameters to
		  be identified. The identification is carried out at the
		  local scale, ie, at any point of the heat source field,
		  without using the boundary conditions. In the present work,
		  the method is applied to the challenging case of
		  hyperelasticity from a heterogeneous test. Due to large
		  deformations undergone by the rubber specimen tested, a
		  motion compensation technique is developed to plot the
		  kinematic and the thermal fields at the same points before
		  reconstructing the heterogeneous heat source field. In the
		  present case, the constitutive parameter of the Neo-Hookean
		  model has been identified, and its distribution has been
		  characterized with respect to the strain state at the
		  surface of a cross-shaped specimen.}

		  maximum yield stress holding the retina and RPE together,
		  giving rise to an irreversible, extended retinal
		  delamination. We also investigate localized, blister-like
		  retinal detachments by balancing mechanical tension in the
		  retina with both the retina–RPE adhesion energy and the
		  hydraulic pressure jump across the retina. For detachments
		  induced by traction forces, we find a critical radius
		  beyond which the blister is unstable to growth. Growth of a
		  detached blister can also be driven by inflamed lesions in
		  which the tissue has a higher choroidal hydraulic
		  conductivity, has insufficient RPE pump activity, or has
		  defective adhesion bonds. We determine the parameter
		  regimes in which the blister either becomes unstable to
		  growth, remains stable and finite-sized, or shrinks,
		  allowing possible healing. The corresponding stable blister
		  radius and shape are calculated. Our analysis provides a
		  quantitative description of the physical mechanisms
		  involved in exudative retinal detachments and can help
		  guide the development of retinal reattachment protocols or

		  shown which attest coherence and efficiency of the method
		  for several heat source distributions and different sets of
		  noisy data. The method is then applied to experimental data
		  files coming from tensile tests on mild steels at the room
		  temperature. Sudden dissipative effects due to the
		  propagation of the Lüders bands during the plastic plateau
		  can be observed. Then, during the strain hardening, gradual
		  and precocious concentrations of dissipation are shown;
		  they herald the local necking of the sample. Finally, the

  abstract	= { The Mullins effect is a common name for a family of
		  intriguing inelastic responses of various solid materials,
		  in particular filled rubbers. Given the importance of the
		  Mullins effect, there have been many attempts to develop
		  mathematical models describing the effect. However, most of
		  the available models focus exclusively on the mechanical
		  response and are restricted to the idealized isothermal
		  setting. We lift the restriction to isothermal processes,
		  and we propose a full thermodynamic framework for a class
		  of phenomenological models of the Mullins effect. In
		  particular, we identify energy storage mechanisms
		  (Helmholtz free energy) and entropy production mechanisms
		  that on the level of stress–strain relation lead to the
		  idealized Mullins effect or to the Mullins effect with
		  permanent strain. The models constructed within the
		  proposed framework can be used in the modelling of fully
		  coupled thermo-mechanical processes, and the models are
		  guaranteed to be consistent with the laws of
		  thermodynamics. }

		  non-isothermal viscoelastic fluid behavior. A general
		  procedure, developed within the framework of thermodynamics
		  of irreversible processes, is proposed to obtain
		  constitutive relations that verify automatically the second
		  law of thermodynamics and the principle of material
		  objectivity. It is shown that the choice of the objective
		  time derivative is important not only to assure a
		  mathematically correct and physically realistic description
		  of the viscoelastic behavior, but also to perform an
		  adequate description of the thermomechanical coupling in
		  the case of non-isothermal flows. Such a thermodynamic
		  approach allows a rational identification of the terms
		  responsible for the thermomechanical coupling in the heat
		  equation, which is a first step to better understand their
		  influence on the fluid behavior."

		  thermodynamic consistency of rate-type constitutive
		  equations for viscoelastic fluids that adopt the
		  Gordon–Schowalter time derivative. The choice of the
		  objective time derivative is important not only to assure a
		  mathematically correct modelling and physically realistic
		  description of the viscoelastic behaviour, but also to
		  perform a thermodynamically consistent modelling. It is
		  shown that, for some very popular constitutive equations
		  that adopt this particular family of objective time
		  derivatives (such as the upper-convected Oldroyd fluids),
		  it is impossible to automatically assure that the second
		  law of thermodynamics is satisfied in any process."

  abstract	= "Subduction initiation is a key in understanding the
		  dynamic evolution of the Earth and its fundamental
		  difference to all other rocky planetary bodies in our solar
		  system. Despite recent progress, the question about how a
		  stiff, mostly stagnant planetary lid can break and become
		  part in the global overturn of the mantle is still
		  unresolved. Many mechanisms, externally or internally
		  driven, are proposed in previous studies. Here, we present
		  the results on subduction initiation obtained by
		  dynamically self-consistent, time-dependent numerical
		  modelling of mantle convection. We show that the stress
		  distribution and resulting deformation of the lithosphere
		  are strongly controlled by the top boundary formulation: A
		  free surface enables surface topography and plate bending,
		  increases gravitational sliding of the plates and leads to
		  more realistic, lithosphere-scale shear zones. As a
		  consequence, subduction initiation induced by regional
		  mantle flow is demonstrably favoured by a free surface
		  compared to the commonly applied, vertically fixed (i.e.
		  free-slip) surface. In addition, we present global,
		  three-dimensional mantle convection experiments that employ
		  basal heating that leads to narrow mantle plumes. Narrow
		  mantle plumes impinging on the base of the plate cause
		  locally weak plate segments and a large topography at the
		  lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. Both are shown to be
		  key to induce subduction initiation. Finally, our model
		  self-consistently reproduces an episodic lid with a fast
		  global overturn due to the hotter mantle developed below a
		  former stagnant lid. We conclude that once in a
		  stagnant-lid mode, a planet (like Venus) might
		  preferentially evolve by temporally discrete, global
		  overturn events rather than by a continuous recycling of
		  lid and that this is something worth testing more
		  rigorously in future studies.",

		  terms of three natural strain invariants, K1–3, which
		  respectively specify the amount-of-dilatation, the
		  magnitude-of-distortion, and the mode-of-distortion.
		  Distortion is that part of the deformation that does not
		  dilate. Moreover, pure dilatation (K2=0), pure shear
		  (K3=0), uniaxial extension (K3=1), and uniaxial contraction
		  (K3=−1) are tests which hold a strain invariant constant.
		  Through an analysis of previously published data, it is
		  shown for rubber that this new approach allows W to be
		  easily determined with improved accuracy. Albeit useful for
		  large and small strains, distinct advantage is shown for
		  moderate strains (e.g. 2–25\%). Central to this work is
		  the orthogonal nature of the invariant basis. If η
		  represents natural strain, then {K1,K2,K3} are such that
		  the tensorial contraction of (∂Ki/∂η) with
		  (∂Kj/∂η) vanishes when i≠j. This result, in turn,
		  allows the Cauchy stress t to be expressed as the sum of
		  three response terms that are mutually orthogonal. In
		  particular (summation implied) t=Ai∂W/∂Ki, where the
		  ∂W/∂Ki are scalar response functions and the Ai are

		  negative features exhibited in other works, commonly
		  attributed to the Fung approach, are merely a consequence
		  of the way it has been applied. The approach outlined
		  herein is shown to yield improved behaviour and offers a
		  straightforward scheme for solving a wide range of models.
		  Results from the new model are contrasted with those in the
		  literature for the case of uniaxial elongation of a bar:
		  for an imposed stretch of an incompressible bar and for an
		  imposed load. In the latter case, a numerical solution to a
		  Volterra integral equation is required to obtain the
		  results. This is achieved by a high-order discretization
		  scheme. Finally, the stretch of a compressible viscoelastic
		  bar is determined for two distinct materials:
		  Horgan–Murphy and Gent. }

		  performed at the surface of the pigskin sample using the

		  resistance of both leathers in terms of the thermal
		  activity in the zone of influence of the crack. The best

		  reader to several synchronization notions and performance

		  formation, and partial synchronization. We present the

		  softening and residual strain effects. The dissipation of
		  energy, i.e. the difference between the energy input during
		  loading and the energy returned on unloading is also
		  accounted for in the model by the use of a dissipation

		  subjected to cyclic loading–unloading with a fixed

		  stress required on reloading is less than on the initial
		  loading for a deformation up to the maximum value of the
		  stretches achieved. The stress differences in successive
		  loading cycles are largest during the first and second
		  cycles and become negligible after about 4–6 cycles. This
		  phenomenon is known as the Mullins effect. In this paper
		  new experimental data are reported showing the change in
		  material symmetry for an initially undamaged and isotropic
		  material subjected to uniaxial and biaxial extension tests.
		  The effect of preconditioning in one direction on the
		  mechanical response when loaded in a perpendicular
		  direction is discussed. A simple phenomenological model is
		  derived to account for stress softening and changes in
		  material symmetry. The formulation is based on the theory
		  of pseudo-elasticity, the basis of which is the inclusion
		  of scalar variables in the energy function. When active,
		  these variables modify the form of the energy function
		  during the deformation process and therefore change the
		  material response. The general formulation is specialized
		  to pure homogeneous deformation in order to fit the new
		  data. The numerical results are in very good agreement with
		  the experimental data.}

  abstract	= "The thermodynamics and mechanics of non-isothermal
		  polymeric fluids are examined within the auspices of a new
		  methodology wherein the laws of physics and principles of
		  mechanics which are applicable to these thermodynamic
		  systems are imbedded in a definite mathematical structure
		  of a general, abstract equation. Such a concept allows new
		  insight to be obtained concerning some aspects of
		  non-isothermal flows of polymeric fluids, and permits a
		  consistent expression and interpretation of other
		  thermodynamic theories for these systems which have been
		  developed over the past forty years. A major portion of
		  this article is devoted to demonstrating the above
		  statements, and in so doing some common misconceptions
		  occurring in a significant fraction of the literature
		  regarding this subject are exposed. The definite
		  mathematical structure of the new methodology permits the
		  thermodynamically consistent generalization of isothermal,
		  incompressible models of polymeric fluids to
		  non-isothermal, compressible conditions. Doing thus
		  reproduces, corrects, and extends non-isothermal models
		  which have been developed over the years, and also allows
		  for simpler (but equivalent) representations of these
		  models in terms of alternate variables with a clearer
		  connection to the microstructure of the material than the
		  stress tensor and heat flux vector fields. Furthermore, a
		  generalization of the GENERIC structure is proposed that
		  accommodates interactions between phenomena of differing
		  parities, which impose antisymmetry upon the corresponding
		  elements of the dissipative operator matrix.",

		  deletion method outside of two-point scalar boundary-value

  abstract	= {A thermodynamically consistent dissipative model is
		  proposed to describe softening phenomena in anisotropic
		  materials. The model is based on a generalized polyconvex
		  anisotropic strain energy function represented by a series.
		  Anisotropic softening is considered by evolution of
		  internal variables governing the anisotropic properties of
		  the material. Accordingly, evolution equations are
		  formulated and anisotropic conditions for the onset of
		  softening are defined. In numerical examples, the model is
		  applied to simulate the preconditioning behavior of soft
		  biological tissues subjected to cyclic loading experiments.
		  The results suggest that the general characteristics of
		  preconditioning with different upper load limits are well
		  captured including hysteresis and residual deformations. A
		  model for the Mullins effect is obtained as a special case
		  and shows very good agreement with experimental data on
		  mouse skin.}

		  Deborah number provided the model includes a spatial
		  diffusion term that is usually neglected in the derivation
		  of the model by assuming that the structure is spatially
		  homogeneous. Although this diffusion term is critical to
		  the existence proof, it is expected to be numerically small
		  compared to other terms in the constitutive model, except
		  possibly in the vicinity of very large stress gradients,
		  which it will tend to smooth out. The proof also requires
		  that the stress always remain bounded. Although it is
		  likely that this will be true for a model with a nonlinear
		  (FENE) spring, it is difficult to prove rigorously. Hence,
		  in the existence proof we resort to an ad hoc assumption
		  that is equivalent to asserting that the polymer breaks
		  (degrades) if the end-to-end distance exceeds some
		  prescribed values that is less than the full cotour length
		  but is otherwise arbitrary. "

		  allows constitutive relations to be constructed without a
		  need to introduce invariant theory. This approach to

		  (PDEs) may permit several distinct solutions. The typical
		  current approach to finding distinct solutions is to start
		  Newton's method with many different initial guesses, hoping
		  to find starting points that lie in different basins of
		  attraction. In this paper, we present an
		  infinite-dimensional deflation algorithm for systematically
		  modifying the residual of a nonlinear PDE problem to
		  eliminate known solutions from consideration. This enables
		  the Newton--Kantorovitch iteration to converge to several
		  different solutions, even starting from the same initial
		  guess. The deflated Jacobian is dense, but an efficient
		  preconditioning strategy is devised, and the number of
		  Krylov iterations is observed not to grow as solutions are
		  deflated. The power of the approach is demonstrated on
		  several problems from special functions, phase separation,
		  differential geometry, and fluid mechanics that permit
		  distinct solutions. }

  abstract	= {Filled rubbers are an important part of engineering
		  materials because they have unique properties such as large
		  deformability, increased stiffness and energy dissipation
		  ability. The complexity of the material model parameter
		  identification and the consideration of essential
		  behaviours such as temperature dependence or residual
		  strain may be a great challenge during the constitutive
		  modelling. In this paper, a hyper-visco-pseudo-elastic
		  constitutive equation is introduced and applied to model
		  the complex behaviour of filled rubbers by considering (i)
		  the Mullins effect, (ii) the temperature effect, and (iii)
		  the effect of residual strains. The time-independent
		  material response is provided by the modified
		  Dorfmann–Ogden pseudo-elastic material model, while the
		  time and temperature dependence is taken into consideration
		  by the Prony series-based linear viscoelastic theory and
		  the time-temperature superposition principle. Furthermore,
		  by assuming homogeneous deformations, numerical stress
		  solutions are presented to perform the material model
		  calibration simple and fast, even when considering uniaxial
		  tension/compression and simple shear simultaneously. The
		  material model can be adapted to handle any hyperelastic
		  model, arbitrary damage and residual strain variable,
		  user-defined time-temperature superposition function, and
		  any number of Maxwell elements (spring-dashpot terms).
		  Here, the model parameters are determined from uniaxial
		  stress relaxation-recovery tests, as well as cyclic
		  uniaxial tensile and cyclic simple shear tests of different
		  strain rates. Finally, the theoretical results are compared
		  with experimental data for an EPDM rubber filled with 50
		  phr of carbon black.}

		  the Onsager, Prigogine as well as the Glansdorff and
		  Ziegler thermodynamic extremal principles (TEPs) to
		  non-equilibrium thermodynamics are examined for systems at
		  fixed temperature with respect to their ability to provide
		  kinetic equations approved in materials science. TEPs
		  represent an alternative to the classical phenomenological
		  equations approach. As TEPs are, more or less, a pure
		  mathematical tool, they cannot significantly contribute to
		  a deeper physical understanding. However, if a system can
		  be described by discrete characteristic (thermodynamic)
		  parameters, it is demonstrated that application of
		  Onsager’s TEP or Ziegler’s TEP represents a systematic
		  way to derive a set of explicit evolution equations for
		  these parameters. This approach can significantly simplify
		  the treatment of the problem and, thus, can also be applied
		  to rather complex systems, for which the classical
		  approach, involving application of phenomenological
		  equations, fails. The application of TEPs is demonstrated
		  on plasticity with respect to constitutive equations as
		  well as on grain growth and coarsening with respect to
		  evolution equations of discrete parameters. No exploitation
		  of Prigogine’s TEP has been reported for applications in
		  materials science. Contrarily, Prigogine’s TEP can be
		  invalidated if the coefficients of the dissipation function
		  depend on the evolution of state variables with time. This
		  is demonstrated by a further practical example worked out
		  for the solute drag phenomenon. Glansdorff’s and
		  Prigogine’s evolution criterion, however, is always
		  fulfilled near the equilibrium state of convex Gibbs
		  energy. Extensions of TEPs to non-linear non-equilibrium
		  thermodynamics are demonstrated for homogeneous and
		  quasi-homogeneous dissipation functions."

		  (NSAC), the Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard (NSCH), and the
		  Navier--Stokes--Korteweg (NSK) equations have been used in
		  the literature to model the dynamics of two-phase fluids.
		  One main purpose of this paper consists in (re-)deriving
		  NSAC, NSCH and NSK from first principles, in the spirit of
		  rational mechanics, for fluids of very general constitutive
		  laws. For NSAC, this deduction confirms and extends a
		  proposal of Blesgen. Regarding NSCH, it continues work of
		  Lowengrub and Truskinovsky and provides the apparently
		  first justified formulation in the non-isothermal case. For
		  NSK, it yields a most natural correction to the formulation
		  by Dunn and Serrin. The paper uniformly recovers as
		  examples various classes of fluids, distinguished according
		  to whether none, one, or both of the phases are
		  compressible, and according to the nature of their
		  co-existence. The latter is captured not only by the mixing
		  energy, but also by a `mixing rule'---a constitutive law
		  that characterizes the type of the mixing. A second main
		  purpose of the paper is to communicate the apparently new
		  observation that in the case of two immiscible
		  incompressible phases of different temperature-independent
		  specific volumes, NSAC reduces literally to NSK. This
		  finding may be considered as an independent justification
		  of NSK. An analogous fact is shown for NSCH, which under
		  the same assumption reduces to a new non-local version of
		  NSK.",

		  friction and internal viscosity are examined in detail for
		  the dumbbell model of dilute polymer solutions in a general

		  flows are investigated and the response of the bulk stress
		  is calculated. The existence of a hysteresis in the steady
		  end-to-end length of the dumbbell, which arises from the
		  variable friction factor, is found to depend strongly on
		  both the flow type (i.e. the ratio of vorticity to the rate
		  of strain) and the moleculecular weight. The influence of
		  internal viscosity is examined in detail using two methods
		  of solution for the problems of transient and steady
		  two-dimensional flows. The first method uses a perturbation
		  expansion valid for small values of the internal viscosity
		  and leads largely to analytical results. The second
		  technique uses the pre-averaging approximation of Cerf and
		  is capable of predicting the model response when the
		  internal viscosity becomes large. The most striking result
		  for large values of the internal viscosity and a linear
		  spring dumbbell is the appearance of multiple steady states
		  in the dumbbell length for flows between simple shear and
		  pure straining, and the removal of the well known
		  singularity in end-to-end length which otherwise appears in
		  the linear dumbbell model at a critical value of the strain
		  rate. "

		  aluminosilicate particles in paraffin oil is studied for
		  its response to sinusoidally oscillating shear strains of
		  frequencies in the range of 300-400 Hz. The response of the
		  material is linear viscoelastic when subjected to electric
		  fields in the range of 0.0-3.0 kV/mm. The linear
		  viscoelastic parameters-shear loss modulus, shear storage
		  modulus, and loss tangent-were calculated and related to
		  the strength of the field applied to the material. The
		  moduli were found to increase with increasing applied field
		  and the loss tangent decreased with increasing applied
		  field. Finally, a nonlinear data correlator program was
		  used to simulate the ER material's shear loss modulus as a
		  function of frequency when modeling the ER material using
		  the constitutive equations for a three-parameter solid.},

  abstract	= "Time parallel time integration methods have received
		  renewed interest over the last decade because of the advent
		  of massively parallel computers, which is mainly due to the
		  clock speed limit reached on today's processors. When
		  solving time dependent partial differential equations, the
		  time direction is usually not used for parallelization. But
		  when parallelization in space saturates, the time direction
		  offers itself as a further direction for parallelization.
		  The time direction is however special, and for evolution
		  problems there is a causality principle: the solution later
		  in time is affected (it is even determined) by the solution
		  earlier in time, but not the other way round. Algorithms
		  trying to use the time direction for parallelization must
		  therefore be special, and take this very different property
		  of the time dimension into account.We show in this chapter
		  how time domain decomposition methods were invented, and
		  give an overview of the existing techniques. Time parallel
		  methods can be classified into four different groups:
		  methods based on multiple shooting, methods based on domain
		  decomposition and waveform relaxation, space-time multigrid
		  methods and direct time parallel methods. We show for each
		  of these techniques the main inventions over time by
		  choosing specific publications and explaining the core
		  ideas of the authors. This chapter is for people who want
		  to quickly gain an overview of the exciting and rapidly
		  developing area of research of time parallel methods.",

		  nonequilibrium treatment of chemical reaction kinetics for
		  media with an internal structure, we develop a
		  thermodynamic model that closely resembles the one based on
		  more ad hoc assumptions. Thus, we not only validate that
		  model, but now also have a mechanism to systematically
		  produce further refinements. One particular refinement,
		  namely, the inclusion of an additional intermediate length

		  Based on the experimental evidence, vulcanized unfilled

		  deforming from a stress-free reference configuration.
		  Vulcanized unfilled rubber undergoes strain-induced
		  crystallization when uniaxial stretch exceeds 2. Therefore,
		  in this study, a non-dissipative model is sought for rubber
		  only till the von Mises stress is below a critical value.
		  Using the biaxial response reported in Kawabata et al.
		  (1981), the material functions are arrived adopting Rivlin
		  and Saunders methodology. The material constants in the
		  determined material functions are found using biaxial tests
		  for four other experimental studies on rubber reported in
		  the literature. The ability of the arrived constitutive
		  model to describe the uniaxial and equal biaxial response
		  of the same rubber is evaluated. The proposed model is
		  benchmarked with established models in the classical
		  framework. Among the models studied the proposed model

		  the proposed model performance does not critically depend

		  found from fixed biaxial experiments for better
		  performance."

  abstract	= { A central tool of nonlinear anelasticity is the
		  multiplicative decomposition of the deformation tensor that
		  assumes that the deformation gradient can be decomposed as
		  a product of an elastic and an anelastic tensor. It is
		  usually justified by the existence of an intermediate
		  configuration. Yet, this configuration cannot exist in
		  Euclidean space, in general, and the mathematical basis for
		  this assumption is on unsatisfactory ground. Here, we
		  derive a sufficient condition for the existence of global
		  intermediate configurations, starting from a multiplicative
		  decomposition of the deformation gradient. We show that
		  these global configurations are unique up to isometry. We
		  examine the result of isometrically embedding these
		  configurations in higher-dimensional Euclidean space, and
		  construct multiplicative decompositions of the deformation
		  gradient reflecting these embeddings. As an example, for a
		  family of radially symmetric deformations, we construct
		  isometric embeddings of the resulting intermediate
		  configurations, and compute the residual stress fields
		  explicitly. }

		  We then show how these methods can be extended to infinite
		  dimensional Navier–Stokes systems using robust
		  optimization techniques. Crucially, this extension requires
		  only the solution of infinite-dimensional linear eigenvalue
		  problems and finite-dimensional sum-of-squares optimization
		  problems. We further show that subject to minor technical
		  constraints, a general polynomial Lyapunov function is
		  always guaranteed to provide better results than the
		  classical energy methods in determining a lower-bound on
		  the maximum Reynolds number for which a flow is globally
		  stable, if the flow does remain globally stable for
		  Reynolds numbers at least slightly beyond the energy
		  stability limit. Such polynomial functions can be searched
		  for efficiently using the SOS technique we propose."

  abstract	= {Following our first report (A Groisman and V Steinberg
		  2000 Nature 405 53), we present an extended account of
		  experimental observations of elasticity-induced turbulence
		  in three different systems: a swirling flow between two
		  plates, a Couette–Taylor (CT) flow between two cylinders,
		  and a flow in a curvilinear channel (Dean flow). All three
		  set-ups had a high ratio of the width of the region
		  available for flow to the radius of curvature of the
		  streamlines. The experiments were carried out with dilute
		  solutions of high-molecular-weight polyacrylamide in
		  concentrated sugar syrups. High polymer relaxation time and
		  solution viscosity ensured prevalence of non-linear elastic
		  effects over inertial non-linearity, and development of
		  purely elastic instabilities at low Reynolds number ( Re )
		  in all three flows. Above the elastic instability
		  threshold, flows in all three systems exhibit features of
		  developed turbulence. They include: (i) randomly
		  fluctuating fluid motion excited in a broad range of
		  spatial and temporal scales and (ii) significant increase
		  in the rates of momentum and mass transfer (compared with
		  those expected for a steady flow with a smooth velocity
		  profile). Phenomenology, driving mechanisms and parameter
		  dependence of the elastic turbulence are compared with
		  those of the conventional high- Re hydrodynamic turbulence
		  in Newtonian fluids. Some similarities as well as multiple
		  principal differences were found. In two out of three
		  systems (swirling flow between two plates and flow in the
		  curvilinear channel), power spectra of velocity
		  fluctuations decayed rather quickly, following power laws
		  with exponents of about −3.5. It suggests that, being
		  random in time, the flow is rather smooth in space, in the
		  sense that the main contribution to deformation and mixing
		  (and, possibly, elastic energy) is coming from flow at the
		  largest scale of the system. This situation, random in time
		  and smooth in space, is analogous to flows at small scales
		  (below the Kolmogorov dissipation scale) in high- Re
		  turbulence.}

		  simplicity that it is possible to characterize the reaction
		  as having a single step and as one in which the reaction
		  products remain within the body, thereby modifying the
		  solid constituent. The effects of the reaction on the solid
		  that render it anisotropic are quantified by means of a
		  tensorial parameter that tracks the extent of the reaction
		  in different directions. Both diffusion-dominated
		  (diffusion of the reactants is far more rapid than the
		  reaction) and reaction-dominated (the reaction is far more
		  rapid than the diffusion of the reactants) processes are
		  considered. Constitutive equations are derived from the
		  requirement that the rate of entropy production be
		  maximized, which makes it possible to characterize the
		  behavior of the body through the specification of three
		  scalar functions: the rate of entropy production function
		  for the mixture, and the Helmholtz free energies of each of
		  the constituents. It is noted that the model may be applied
		  to regions of bodies with locally homogeneous damage, that
		  is, regions damaged at a small enough scale to mimic an
		  anisotropically porous continuum. Macroscale damage may
		  also be modeled via the boundary conditions described in
		  Section 5. }

		  aspects for finite element simulations at the engineering
		  scale. The photomechanical continuum framework is
		  summarized, and some specific constitutive equations for

		  multiphysics governing partial differential equations takes
		  the form of a user defined element subroutine within the
		  commercial software package ABAQUS. We verify our
		  two‐dimensional and three‐dimensional finite element
		  procedure for multiple analytically tractable cases. To
		  show the robustness of the numerical implementation,

		  phase and liquid phase that can occur during the cooling of
		  a binary alloy. The solid phase forms as a matrix of
		  crystals--often dendrites--which resembles a porous medium
		  of spatially varying permeability. This permeability
		  diminishes in time as further solid freezes out of the
		  liquid phase as it percolates through the matrix. The
		  theory developed here is general enough to incorporate
		  these and other ingredients essential to a proper
		  theoretical treatment of a mushy zone. A simple
		  one-dimensional freezing problem is formulated and solved.

		  the response of the viscoelastic fluid under deformation.
		  The starting point of the analysis is based on the
		  second-order, symmetric conformation tensor. As such, the
		  final model is slightly different from previous models in
		  terms of the extra-stress tensor as the primary variable.
		  The solution of the governing equations is found
		  analytically for all the dependent variables except for a
		  constant which is introduced by the separation of variables
		  method. A physical singular point of the solution is also
		  revealed explicitly. The singularity is taken into account
		  in order to construct very accurate high-order asymptotic
		  solutions for the unknown constant. Further reprocessing of
		  the asymptotic solutions by means of non-linear techniques
		  which accelerate the convergence of series, result in more
		  accurate analytical expressions even close to the
		  singularity of the solutions."

  abstract	= { With the goal of providing the first example of
		  application of a recently proposed method, thus
		  demonstrating its ability to give results in principle,
		  global stability of a version of the rotating Couette flow
		  is examined. The flow depends on the Reynolds number and a
		  parameter characterizing the magnitude of the Coriolis
		  force. By converting the original Navier–Stokes equations
		  to a finite-dimensional uncertain dynamical system using a
		  partial Galerkin expansion, high-degree polynomial Lyapunov
		  functionals were found by sum-of-squares of polynomials
		  optimization. It is demonstrated that the proposed method
		  allows obtaining the exact global stability limit for this
		  flow in a range of values of the parameter characterizing
		  the Coriolis force. Outside this range a lower bound for
		  the global stability limit was obtained, which is still
		  better than the energy stability limit. In the course of
		  the study, several results meaningful in the context of the
		  method used were also obtained. Overall, the results
		  obtained demonstrate the applicability of the recently
		  proposed approach to global stability of the fluid flows.
		  To the best of our knowledge, it is the first case in which
		  global stability of a fluid flow has been proved by a
		  generic method for the value of a Reynolds number greater
		  than that which could be achieved with the energy stability
		  approach. }

  abstract	= {In this paper, we demonstrate the consequence of using
		  different equivalent models to represent a lattice system
		  consisting of mass-in-mass units and why negative mass is
		  needed in the equivalent model. Dispersive wave propagation
		  in the lattice system is studied and compared to various
		  equivalent models. It is found that, if the classical
		  elastic continuum is used to represent the original
		  mass-in-mass lattice system, the effective mass density
		  becomes frequency dependent and may become negative for
		  frequencies near the resonance frequency of the internal
		  mass. In contrast, if a multi-displacement microstructure
		  continuum model is used to represent the mass-in-mass
		  lattice system, the dispersive behavior of wave propagation
		  and the band gap structure can be adequately described.
		  However, while the acoustic mode is accurately described by
		  the microstructure continuum model, the description of the
		  optical mode is accurate only for a limited frequency
		  range.}

		  The equations are reformulated as a system for the triple

		  simple optimization technique for analysing the nonlinear
		  stability of a state in a dynamical system. The technique
		  can be used to identify the most efficient way to disturb a
		  system such that it transits from one stable state to
		  another. The key idea is introduced within the framework of
		  a finite-dimensional set of ordinary differential equations
		  (ODEs) and then illustrated for a very simple system of two
		  ODEs which possesses bistability. Then the transition to
		  turbulence problem in fluid mechanics is used to show how
		  the technique can be formulated for a spatially-extended
		  system described by a set of partial differential equations
		  (the well-known Navier–Stokes equations). Within that
		  context, the optimization technique bridges the gap between
		  (linear) optimal perturbation theory and the (nonlinear)
		  dynamical systems approach to fluid flows. The fact that
		  the technique has now been recently shown to work in this
		  very high dimensional setting augurs well for its utility
		  in other physical systems.}

		  technique for analyzing the nonlinear stability of a flow
		  state. It is based on a nonlinear extension of nonmodal
		  analysis and, in its simplest form, consists of finding the
		  disturbance to the flow state of a given amplitude that
		  experiences the largest energy growth at a certain time
		  later. When coupled with a search over the disturbance
		  amplitude, this can reveal the disturbance of least
		  amplitude—called the minimal seed—for transition to
		  another state such as turbulence. The approach bridges the
		  theoretical gap between (linear) nonmodal theory and the
		  (nonlinear) dynamical systems approach to fluid flows by
		  allowing one to explore phase space at a finite distance
		  from the reference flow state. Various ongoing and
		  potential applications of the technique are discussed.}

		  model capturing anisotropic stress softening in reinforced
		  elastomers under quasi-static loading is presented. A novel
		  spatial distribution function of polymer chains taking into
		  account its deformation induced anisotropic alignment is
		  proposed. By this means, the anisotropic network averaging
		  over the unit sphere can be evaluated analytically. The
		  anisotropic alignment of polymer chains introduces
		  non-affine deformation in the model. Furthermore, the
		  anisotropic evolution of the Mullins effect and hysteresis
		  are also derived analytically, so that no numerical
		  integration is applied here. The model includes very few
		  physically motivated material parameters and demonstrates
		  good agreement with multi-dimensional experimental data as
		  well as with molecular dynamics simulations.}

		  measurements are inadequate because they only provide a

		  filled natural rubbers is coupled with the infrared
		  thermography-based quantitative surface calorimetry (Part
		  I) to shed new light on multiaxiality of strain-induced

		  additional parameters (compared to the equilibrium
		  crystallization theory), underlying mechanisms of
		  nonequilibrium strain-induced crystallization can be well
		  interpreted. To capture multiaxiality of strain-induced

		  predictions are then compared with comprehensive testing

		  During the mechanical tests, the temperature was measured
		  by using infrared thermography and processed by means of
		  the heat diffusion equation for determining the
		  corresponding heat power density. The intrinsic dissipation
		  due to viscosity and stress softening are evaluated under
		  cyclic loading by the energy balance. Energy contributions
		  to the hysteresis loop converted into heat and stored in
		  the material are distinguished. The heat power density is
		  also used to evaluate the strain-induced crystallinity.
		  This analysis provides new results on the energetic
		  behavior of filled natural rubber. Accordingly,
		  crystallization takes place under high biaxiality levels,
		  close to the equibiaxial loading condition, while
		  multiaxiality influences the crystallization onset. These
		  experimental results are used in the second part of the
		  present paper for a physically based modeling of the

		  Such a discussion could serve as a guide to the formulation
		  of a model for the problem at hand. We look into the
		  frequently neglected area of kinematic description, drawing
		  from this field criticism of third Truesdell's metaphysical
		  principle. Balance laws are carefully formulated for
		  partial quantities with discontinuities for both theory of
		  interacting continua and for averaging theories. Further,
		  we discuss definitions of mixture quantities together with
		  Truesdell's metaphysical principles. Finally, we use
		  classical irreversible thermodynamics to derive entropy
		  production for mixture as a whole and thus reaching an
		  extension of its classical form, evolution equations
		  (phenomenological equations), and constitutive relations.
		  As this fundamental step is very much dependent on the use
		  of non equilibrium thermodynamics, we give a brief overview
		  of the theories available. }

		  material. In the present study the theory of mixtures is

		  air in a purely mechanical system in which the thermal
		  effects and chemical reactions are ignored. Constitutive
		  relation for each component of the mixture is assumed to be
		  dependent only on the kinematical quantities associated
		  with each component. The resulting hyperbolic conservation
		  equations are solved by an upwind finite volume scheme
		  coupled with an operator splitting technique for a
		  quasi-static type of loading. The numerical scheme is used
		  to simulate the variation of air voids content across the
		  thickness of a typical road pavement. "

		  the finitely extendable nonlinear elastic (FENE) chain
		  models which account for molecular stretch, bending, and
		  topology. More coarse-grained descriptions such as
		  primitive path models, and elongated particle models are
		  reviewed as well. We focus on their inherently anisotropic
		  material—in particular rheological—properties via
		  deterministic and stochastic approaches. A number of
		  representative examples are given on how simple (often
		  high-dimensional) models can, and have been implemented in
		  order to enable the analysis of the microscopic origins of
		  the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of polymeric materials.
		  These examples are shown to provide us with a number of
		  routes for developing and establishing coarse-grained
		  (low-dimensional) models devoted to the prediction of a
		  reduced number of significant material properties. At this
		  stage approximations which allow for an analytical
		  treatment are discussed as well. Concerning the types of
		  complex fluids, we cover the range from flexible to
		  semiflexible polymers in melts and solutions, wormlike
		  micelles, structural suspensions including ferrofluids in
		  field-induced anisotropic or liquid crystalline phases."

		  numerical models. The focus is on the influence of
		  non-linearities on the filtering properties of the chain in
		  the low frequency range. Periodic systems with alternating
		  properties exhibit interesting dynamic characteristics that
		  enable them to act as filters. Waves can propagate along
		  them within specific bands of frequencies called pass
		  bands, and attenuate within bands of frequencies called
		  stop bands or band gaps. Stop bands in structures with
		  periodic or random inclusions are located mainly in the
		  high frequency range, as the wavelength has to be
		  comparable with the distance between the alternating parts.
		  Band gaps may also exist in structures with locally
		  attached oscillators. In the linear case the gap is located
		  around the resonant frequency of the oscillators, and thus
		  a stop band can be created in the lower frequency range. In
		  the case with non-linear oscillators the results show that
		  the position of the band gap can be shifted, and the shift
		  depends on the amplitude and the degree of non-linear
		  behaviour.}

		  crucial for antivibration parts that require both good

		  high dissipation under cyclic loading. Moreover, these
		  parts exhibit complex shapes leading to complex local
		  mechanical fields and therefore to thermal sources and
		  temperature fields difficult to predict. To overcome the
		  difficulties of the classical approach based on

		  needs, a simple phenomenological approach was previously
		  suggested. We aim at validating this approach for several

		  proposed to identify efficiently the parameters of the
		  thermal and mechanical problems, from a single test on an
		  hourglass-shaped specimen. The validity of the
		  identification step and of the modeling is then challenged
		  by the confrontation of the numerical predictions to the
		  results of an extended experimental database. The
		  influences of the main influent factors are investigated
		  (displacement amplitude, frequency, load ratio, sample

		  well known that converged solutions for the stress in the
		  wake downstream of the cylinder cannot be obtained when the
		  Weissenberg number exceeds 0.7. This has been an unresolved
		  problem [M.A. Alves, P.J. Oliveira and F.T. Pinho, Annu.
		  Rev. Fluid Mech., 53:509-41, 2021]. This problem has
		  various origins, such as the validity of numerical methods
		  and the constitutive equation. This study examines the
		  relationship between the convergence with respect to mesh
		  refinement and the thermodynamically modified Oldroyd-B
		  fluid, which has a diffusion term. We show that stress
		  diffusion is thermodynamically natural and contributes to
		  the convergence of the numerical solution for the Oldroyd-B
		  fluid flow past a cylinder. Stress diffusion has typically
		  been neglected because of its small value, although it is
		  inherent to real polymers. The diffusion term does not
		  change the flow behavior significantly but facilitates the
		  determination of a mesh converged stress solution for the
		  Weissenberg number up to 0.8. This result cannot be
		  obtained from the original Oldroyd-B model. It is thus
		  revealed that the diffusion term can effectively stabilize
		  the stress in the region of steep stress gradients.}

		  polymer, has attracted considerable attention due to its

		  as matrix materials in producing nano-filled stretchable

		  findings illustrate that Ecoflex experiences a significant
		  stress softening in the first cycles and such a softening
		  recovers gradually with respect to time. It also shows a
		  significant amount of cyclic dissipations at various
		  stretch levels as well as a considerable stress relaxation
		  only for virgin samples. Cyclic dissipations and stress
		  relaxation almost disappear for the case of pre-stretched

		  represent its wide range of stiffnesses. In this
		  contribution, we have conducted a plethora of experiments
		  under the uniaxial mode of tensile deformation. These
		  experiments consist of loading-unloading cyclic tests,
		  stretchability tests, single-step relaxation tests, Mullins
		  effect tests, stress recovery tests, and
		  temperature-dependence tests at different strain levels.
		  All tests are revisited with Ecoflex of five Shore
		  hardnesses ranging from Shore 00–10 to Shore 00–50.
		  Extensive experimental findings illustrate that the
		  material consists of an equilibrium stress part and an
		  overstress part. Constitutive frameworks with an amplified
		  strain invariant are proposed to predict the mechanical
		  responses of Ecoflex over a wide range of Shore hardnesses.
		  Afterwards, the frameworks are extended to capture the
		  stress softening behaviour significantly observed in the
		  material. Relevant examples illustrate that proposed
		  constitutive models accurately predict stress-strain
		  responses and the stress softening behaviour of Ecoflex.
		  The current experimental study will work as a guide in
		  selecting Ecoflex with an appropriate Shore hardness for
		  applications in stretch sensors, soft robotics, and energy
		  harvesters. Moreover, the novel concept of Shore-dependent
		  modelling proposed herein can be applied to predict the
		  stress-strain behaviour of other soft polymers appearing
		  with various Shore hardnesses where there exist
		  difficulties in obtaining experimental data of a particular
		  Shore hardness.}

		  has proven to be an ideal polymer for producing devices
		  made of electric field-responsive functional materials,
		  e.g., actuators in soft robotics, stretch sensors in
		  wearable devices, and energy harvesters generating power
		  from ambient motions. The VHB polymer is commercially
		  available in several thicknesses. For this study, we have
		  selected VHB 4905 due to its wide use as a common material
		  for dielectric elastomers. The acrylic-based polymer is
		  highly deformable, extremely viscoelastic, and highly
		  sensitive to temperature fluctuations. Hence, in order to
		  understand its mechanical and electro-mechanical behaviour,
		  extensive experiments need to be conducted to unravel
		  temperature dependencies in addition to strain-rate
		  dependences. In this study, we present a wide variety of
		  temperature experiments ranging from -30°C to 80°C at
		  various strain rates and stretch levels under homogeneous
		  deformation and temperature fields. The study demonstrates
		  a pronounced influence of the temperature on the mechanical
		  response of the VHB polymer. For VHB within the temperature
		  range of our study, an increased temperature mechanically
		  softens the material and vice-versa. After conducting a
		  wide range of experiments, we propose a finite strain
		  thermo-viscoelastic constitutive model that is an extension
		  of a phenomenologically-motivated model where a non-linear
		  evolution law is devised based on the classical concept of
		  the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation
		  gradient. Then, decoupled one-dimensional equations are
		  derived and fitted to experimental data to identify
		  relevant material parameters appearing in the model. The
		  thermo-viscoelastic model validation shows its reasonably
		  good capability to predict the experimental results."

  abstract	= "This essay investigates the temperature dependence of the
		  mechanical properties of a filler-loaded tread compound
		  experimentally and proposes a physically based method to
		  represent this behaviour in the framework of non-linear
		  continuum thermomechanics. To this end, we realise a series
		  of monotonic and cyclic strain controlled tests on
		  cylindrical specimens in tension at different temperature
		  levels. The experimental data show the isothermal
		  mechanical behaviour to be mainly influenced by non-linear
		  elasticity in combination with non-linear rate dependence
		  and weak equilibrium hysteresis. We observe that the rate
		  sensitivity of the material depends strongly on the
		  temperature : at low temperature levels, the rate
		  sensitivity is essentially higher than at high
		  temperatures. The elastic properties of the material depend
		  comparatively less on the temperature. Nevertheless, higher
		  temperature levels lead to higher equilibrium stresses. In
		  order to represent the material behaviour, we start with a
		  multiplicative split of the deformation gradient into a
		  mechanical and a thermal part as proposed by Lu and Pister
		  (1975). Physically, this idea corresponds to a stress-free
		  thermal expansion followed by an isothermal
		  stress-producing deformation. We suppose the thermal part
		  of the deformation gradient to be isotropic. As a
		  consequence of this, the velocity gradient decomposes
		  additively into a pure thermal and a pure mechanical part.
		  By using these elements, we exploit the Clausius Duhem
		  inequality and assume the so-called ‘mechanical second
		  Piola Kirchhoff stress tensor’ to be a functional of the
		  ‘mechanical Green's strain tensor’. In a further step,
		  we define this functional by a system of constitutive
		  equations which are based on a rheological model. The
		  evolution equations for the internal variables are
		  formulated by using the concept of dual variables proposed
		  by Haupt and Tsakmakis (1989, 1996). The rate sensitivity
		  is modelled by a stress and temperature dependent viscosity
		  function. The elastic part of the equilibrium stress is
		  described by entropy elasticity in combination with a
		  modified Mooney Rivlin strain energy function. The
		  equilibrium hysteresis effects are represented by rate
		  independent plasticity in arclength representation as
		  proposed by Valanis (1971). The constitutive model is
		  compatible with the dissipation principle of thermodynamics
		  and describes the general trend of the experimental data
		  fairly well."

		  effort. Miehe and Schänzel, 2014 introduced a
		  rate-independent phase-field damage model for finite
		  strains in which a viscous damage regularization was
		  proposed. We extend the model to depend on the loading rate
		  and time by incorporating rubber’s strain-rate dependency
		  in the constitutive description of the bulk, as well as in
		  the damage driving force. The parameters of the model are
		  identified using experiments at different strain rates.
		  Local strain fields near the crack tip, obtained with
		  digital image correlation (DIC), are used to help identify
		  the length scale parameter. Three different degradation
		  functions are assessed for their accuracy to model the
		  rubber’s rate-dependent fracture. An adaptive
		  time-stepping approach with a corrector scheme is
		  furthermore employed to increase the computational
		  efficiency with a factor of six, whereas an active set
		  method guarantees the irreversibility of damage. Results
		  detailing the energy storage and dissipation of the
		  different model constituents are included, as well as

  abstract	= {One of the fundamental problems in simulating the motion
		  of sharp interfaces between immiscible fluids is a
		  description of the transition that occurs when the
		  interfaces merge and reconnect. It is well known that
		  classical methods involving sharp interfaces fail to
		  describe this type of phenomena. Following some previous
		  work in this area, we suggest a physically motivated
		  regularization of the Euler equations which allows
		  topological transitions to occur smoothly. In this model,
		  the sharp interface is replaced by a narrow transition
		  layer across which the fluids may mix. The model describes
		  a flow of a binary mixture, and the internal structure of
		  the interface is determined by both diffusion and motion.
		  An advantage of our regularization is that it automatically
		  yields a continuous description of surface tension, which
		  can play an important role in topological transitions. An
		  additional scalar field is introduced to describe the
		  concentration of one of the fluid components and the
		  resulting system of equations couples the Euler (or
		  Navier{\textendash}Stokes) and the
		  Cahn{\textendash}Hilliard equations. The model takes into
		  account weak non{\textendash}locality (dispersion)
		  associated with an internal length scale and localized
		  dissipation due to mixing. The non{\textendash}locality
		  introduces a dimensional surface energy; dissipation is
		  added to handle the loss of regularity of solutions to the
		  sharp interface equations and to provide a mechanism for
		  topological changes. In particular, we study a
		  non{\textendash}trivial limit when both components are
		  incompressible, the pressure is kinematic but the velocity
		  field is non{\textendash}solenoidal
		  (quasi{\textendash}incompressibility). To demonstrate the
		  effects of quasi{\textendash}incompressibility, we analyse
		  the linear stage of spinodal decomposition in one
		  dimension. We show that when the densities of the fluids
		  are not perfectly matched, the evolution of the
		  concentration field causes fluid motion even if the fluids
		  are inviscid. In the limit of infinitely thin and
		  well{\textendash}separated interfacial layers, an
		  appropriately scaled quasi{\textendash}incompressible
		  Euler{\textendash}Cahn{\textendash}Hilliard system
		  converges to the classical sharp interface model. In order
		  to investigate the behaviour of the model outside the range
		  of parameters where the sharp interface approximation is
		  sufficient, we consider a simple example of a change of
		  topology and show that the model permits the transition to
		  occur without an associated singularity.},

		  rheology. It presents the stochastic simulation techniques
		  for solving the Langevin equation. It introduces the
		  stochastic differential equations for dilute polymer
		  solutions modeled by dumbbells. Micro-macro techniques for
		  simulating flows of polymeric fluids are discussed in the
		  chapter. These methods are based on coupling macroscopic
		  techniques for solving the conservation equations with
		  microscopic methods for determining the polymeric stress in
		  the fluid. Some of the early attempts to reduce the
		  statistical error in the stochastic simulations without
		  increasing the number of realizations are described in the
		  chapter. Some of the major advances in the development and
		  implementation of micro-macro techniques presented, such as
		  the method of Brownian configuration fields of Hulsen, van
		  Heel, and van den Brule. The chapter also describes
		  efficient implicit schemes for micro-macro simulations
		  developed by Laso, Ramírez, and Picasso. These schemes
		  give rise to a large nonlinear system of algebraic
		  equations for both the macroscopic and microscopic degrees
		  of freedom at each time step with efficiency being achieved
		  using size reduction techniques. A brief account of the
		  solution of stochastic differential equations for linear
		  polymer melts based on the Doi–Edwards model is discussed
		  in the chapter. The deterministic numerical methods based
		  on the Fokker–Planck equation for several kinetic theory
		  models of polymer fluids are discussed in the chapter."

		  Both effects were recently reported on a new kind of

		  characterization of anisotropy induced by the Mullins
		  effect in a particle-reinforced silicone rubber.
		  Experimental data concerning the influence of type and
		  direction of initial loading on the subsequent stress
		  softening are quite scarce. In this scope, a set of
		  experimental tests were carried out on a filled silicone
		  rubber. Uniaxial tensile tests and bulge tests were used to
		  precondition the samples, i.e., to induce some primary
		  stress softening. In both cases, subsequent uniaxial
		  tensile tests were conducted on preconditioned specimens.
		  The first set of experiments consists of a uniaxial tension
		  path followed by uniaxial tension along different
		  directions. It appears that the stress softening varies
		  from a maximum in the same direction load to a minimum in
		  the orthogonal direction, with respect to the first tensile
		  load direction. Next, the bulge test is proposed as an
		  original way to yield very different biaxial tensile
		  strain-histories for first loading path. The fact that the
		  biaxiality ratio varies from the pole (uniaxial tension)
		  until the bulge border (planar tension), permits to analyze
		  second tensile load curves in a material that experienced a
		  more complex first load path. These experimental data allow
		  to discuss the most appropriate criteria to describe the
		  strain-induced anisotropy phenomenon.}

		  a simple equation relating parameters of

		  energy and the stabilization period of isothermal volume
		  relaxation response. It can be expected that in

		  temperature dependence of the stabilization period is
		  controlled by the parameter θ=Δh∗/RT2g. Materials with
		  higher value of parameter θ (organic polymers) exhibit
		  relatively low relaxation rate. In contrast, higher
		  relaxation rate is expected for materials with low value of
		  θ (inorganic glasses). The applicability of this approach
		  for analysis of previously reported isothermal volume

		  materials, which consist of a network of flexible polymeric
		  chains, is that the deformation response is dominated by
		  changes in entropy. Accordingly, most classical theories of
		  rubber-like elasticity consider only the entropy and
		  neglect any changes in internal energy. On the other hand,
		  the fracture of strongly cross-linked elastomers is
		  essentially energy dominated, as argued in the well-known
		  Lake–Thomas model for the toughness of elastomers.
		  However, a single model unifying these two phenomena is

		  deformation and fracture of cross-linked polymers, based on
		  two ingredients: (i) a non-Gaussian statistical mechanics
		  model of polymer chains that accounts for the increase in
		  energy due to the deformation of molecular bonds; (ii) a
		  chain scission criterion based on the bond deformation
		  energy attaining a critical value. Using this model, we can
		  estimate the rupture stretch of elastomeric materials from
		  fundamental quantities describing the polymer network. We
		  use this model to relate the flaw sensitivity of elastomers

		  some detail because of the quite considerable degree of
		  commercial success that quadrupole technology has achieved.
		  The quadrupole ion trap, often used in conjunction with a
		  quadrupole mass filter, remained a laboratory curiosity
		  until 1979 when, at the American Society for Mass
		  Spectrometry Conference in Seattle, George Stafford, Jr.,
		  of Finnigan Corp., learned of the Masters' study of Allison
		  Armitage of a combined quadrupole ion trap/quadrupole mass
		  filter instrument for the observation of electron impact
		  and chemical ionization mass spectra of simple compounds
		  eluting from a gas chromatograph. Stafford developed
		  subsequently the mass-selective axial instability method
		  for obtaining mass spectra from the quadrupole ion trap
		  alone and, in 1983, Finnigan Corp. announced the first
		  commercial quadrupole ion trap instrument as a detector for
		  a gas chromatograph. In 1987, confinement of ions generated
		  externally to the ion trap was demonstrated and, soon
		  after, the new technique of electrospray ionization was
		  shown to be compatible with the ion trap. © 2009 Wiley

		  challenges, simultaneously at three levels: at the level of

		  and that of their mathematical treatment. This chapter is
		  devoted to the mathematical treatment after a brief
		  discussion of the derivation of such models. Recent results
		  about existence and uniqueness of strong solutions as well
		  as global existence of weak solutions will be discussed. At
		  the mathematical level, one of the main difficulties comes
		  from the coupling of the Navier-Stokes system with a

  abstract	= "Abstract The thermomechanics of continua with internal
		  variables of state is often presented as an alternative to
		  rational continuum mechanics or an extension of the
		  classical linear theory of irreversible processes. It has
		  become ubiquitous in the theories of dissipative mechanical
		  phenomena such as viscoelasticity, plasticity, damage,
		  phase transformations in deformable solids, and the
		  rheology of many fluids. The present contribution
		  highlights the historical development of this fruitful
		  approach since the early works of Duhem, Bridgman, and
		  Eckart, and then the quite definite framework more recently
		  delineated in studies by Kestin and Muschik. It peruses the
		  vast field of successful applications in both solid and
		  fluid mechanics as well as in the theory of coupled fields
		  in the second half of the twentieth century. It also
		  necessarily envisages further generalizations of –
		  deviations from, and contradictions with – this well
		  defined framework with the introduction of gradients, and
		  the difficulties posed by these in the interpretation of
		  the variables. Globally, this pragmatic approach has proved
		  its efficiency in dealing with complex behaviours of
		  continua over a period that started more than a hundred
		  years ago with ideas put forward by Duhem. “So hidden in
		  this hocus-pocus There lies the gift of double focus”

		  constitutive equations based on a thermodynamic framework.
		  The model was applied to a semi-crystalline polyamide
		  polymer, PA66. The experiments included tension and shear
		  testing coupled with synchronized digital image correlation
		  and infrared measurements device for capturing the time,
		  temperature, and stress state dependence, as well as the
		  complex thermomechanical coupling exhibited by the material
		  under large deformation. A notion of equivalent strain rate
		  (based on the time–temperature principle superposition)
		  was also introduced to show its capability to build master
		  curves and therefore decrease the number of testing needed
		  to build a material database. The model is based on the
		  Edward Vilgis theory (1986) and accounts for chains network
		  reorganization under external loading through the
		  introduction of an evolution equation for the internal
		  state variable, η¯, representing the degree of mobility
		  of entanglement points. The model accounting for the
		  equivalent strain rate notion was calibrated using master
		  curves. The thermomechanical model agreed well with the
		  experimental mechanical and temperature measurements under
		  tension and shear conditions. The approach developed in
		  this study may open a different way to model the polymer

		  coordinates are the six elements of the triangular matrix.
		  They are the usual strain elements of infinitesimal strain
		  theory, if a suitable geometrical restriction is applied.
		  The use of this restriction and of these coordinates
		  facilitates a discussion of the stability of a phase, which
		  differs from previous treatments. It is shown that it is
		  necessary to ensure that the mechanical equilibrium
		  condition of vanishing total moments be maintained
		  throughout any variation, by the use of geometrical
		  constraints. The well known difficulty of the so-called
		  trivial instability of a compressed strut does not occur in
		  this treatment, and the thermodynamic stability of a phase
		  can be tested against any variation of intrinsic elastic
		  strain whatsoever. A fundamental error in a recent
		  criticism by the author of the Coleman-Noll inequality is
		  acknowledged, and this inequality is briefly discussed.}

		  that both the virgin loading and the damaged
		  unloading–reloading behavior may be measured, but only
		  the unloading–reloading curve corresponds to hyperelastic
		  behavior. The damaged unloading–reloading curve is the
		  true hyperelastic behavior and may be described by any
		  suitable hyperelastic constitutive model. We employ a
		  spline-based formulation which is known to exactly capture
		  the behavior. The virgin loading curve, which does not
		  correspond to hyperelastic behavior and involves damage
		  evolution is only employed to compute the energy release
		  rate. The procedure does not employ any material parameter
		  (and hence no parameter-fitting procedure) or any explicit
		  damage evolution function. We highlight similarities and
		  differences of the present model with usual damage
		  mechanics models and with pseudo-elasticity. As a result of
		  the detailed computational procedure which simply involves
		  the solution of a nonlinear scalar function, the virgin
		  loading curve and the damaged unloading–reloading curves
		  are exactly captured. The computational algorithm for
		  three-dimensional implicit finite element analysis is also
		  addressed in detail. Examples show that there is no
		  significant increase in computational effort respect to a
		  pure hyperelastic model.}

		  response, a rate-dependent viscoelastic overstress response
		  and a rate-independent plastoelastic overstress response.
		  The damage is assumed to act isotropically on all three
		  branches. These three branches are represented in a
		  completely analogous format within separate eigenvalue
		  spaces, where we apply a recently proposed compact setting
		  of finite inelasticity based on developing reference metric
		  tensors. On the numerical side, we propose a time
		  integration scheme which exploits intrinsically the modular
		  structure of the proposed constitutive model. This is
		  achieved on the basis of a convenient operator split of the
		  local evolution system, which we decouple into a stress
		  evolution problem and a parameter evolution problem. The
		  constitutive functions involved in the proposed model are
		  specified for a particular filled rubber on the basis of a
		  parameter identification process. The paper concludes with
		  some numerical examples which demonstrate the overall
		  response of the proposed model by means of a representative
		  set of numerical examples."

  abstract	= { In this paper, we suggest a new perspective, where
		  Newton's second law of motion is replaced by a more general
		  law which is a better approximation for describing the
		  motion of seemingly rigid macroscopic bodies. We confirm a
		  finding of Willis that the density of a body at a given
		  frequency of oscillation can be anisotropic. The relation
		  between the force and the acceleration is non-local (but
		  causal) in time. Conversely, for every response function
		  satisfying these properties, and having the appropriate
		  high-frequency limit, there is a model which realizes that
		  response function. In many circumstances, the differences
		  between Newton's second law and the new law are small, but
		  there are circumstances, such as in specially designed
		  composite materials, where the difference is enormous. For
		  bodies which are not seemingly rigid, the continuum
		  equations of elastodynamics govern behaviour and also need
		  to be modified. The modified versions of these equations
		  presented here are a generalization of the equations
		  proposed by Willis to describe elastodynamics in composite
		  materials. It is argued that these new sets of equations
		  may apply to all physical materials, not just composites.
		  The Willis equations govern the behaviour of the average
		  displacement field whereas one set of new equations governs
		  the behaviour of the average-weighted displacement field,
		  where the weighted displacement field may attach zero
		  weight to ‘hidden’ areas in the material where the
		  displacement may be unobservable or not defined. From
		  knowledge of the average-weighted displacement field, one
		  obtains an approximate formula for the ensemble averaged
		  energy density. Two other sets of new equations govern the
		  behaviour when the microstructure has microinertia, i.e.
		  where there are internal spinning masses below the chosen
		  scale of continuum modelling. In the first set, the average
		  displacement field is assumed to be observable, while in
		  the second set an average-weighted displacement field is
		  assumed to be observable. }

		  based on a recently developed three-dimensional

		  core idea of the theory is to incorporate pre-full-yield
		  microplastic deformations in a computationally efficient
		  way. Fatigue life is then correlated to the accumulated
		  (micro)plastic work, which is obtained from the total
		  plastic dissipation. The constitutive parameters required
		  are calibrated using just a monotonic stress-strain curve
		  determined from a simple compression test experiment
		  together with a low cycle uniaxial fatigue experiment. The
		  resulting three-dimensional constitutive model has also
		  been implemented into the Abaqus/Explicit finite element
		  program through a vectorized user-material subroutine
		  interface with a fully-implicit, unconditionally-stable and
		  robust time integration scheme. Using the
		  suitably-calibrated constitutive model, a series of
		  uniaxial and multiaxial stress- and strain-based,
		  constant-amplitude fatigue finite element simulations have
		  been conducted to compare with the physical experiment data
		  from the literature. It is shown that the developed theory
		  and its finite-element implementation (which have fewer
		  parameters than cycle counting based methods) are able to
		  better predict the experimental fatigue life under
		  multiaxial proportional or non-proportional loading
		  conditions.}

		  constitutive model has been developed to predict the

		  based solely on the monotonic stress strain curve and a
		  cyclic test for a few cycles ( <  1000). The key to the
		  development of the model is that the “microplastic
		  response” before full yield is accounted for by a new
		  approach to inelastic modeling while retaining a rate
		  independent response. A numerical algorithm based on the
		  one-dimensional version of the constitutive theory has also
		  been implemented into a computer code to model fatigue
		  loading under simple tension/compression i.e. uniaxial
		  loading conditions. The material parameters in the
		  constitutive model were calibrated through fitting the
		  constitutive model to the monotonic stress–strain curve
		  obtained from a simple compression test experiment. By
		  adopting the total inelastic work dissipation (which is
		  related to the configurational entropy created due to
		  damage) as the failure criteria and integrating the rate of
		  entropy generation (under isothermal conditions) over a
		  typical stabilized hysteresis cycle (including the small
		  scale effects due to microplasticity), a close-formed
		  expression for stress-fatigue life prediction is also
		  derived for zero mean stress. Finally, it is shown that the
		  model and numerical algorithm are able to predict the
		  experimental stress-life and strain-life (with and without
		  mean stress) responses quite well.}

		  in softening of rubber and that the initial stress-strain
		  curve determined during the first deformation is unique and
		  cannot be retraced. Further the effect of repeated
		  deformation is to cause rubber asymptotically to approach a
		  steady state with a constant or equilibrium stress-strain
		  curve. Softening in this way occurs in vulcanizates either
		  with or without fillers although the effect appears to be
		  much more pronounced in vulcanizates containing high
		  proportions of reinforcing fillers. After the hardness test
		  the simple extension stress-strain test is the test most
		  widely used by rubber technologists. The conventional
		  stress-strain curve is obtained on samples which have not
		  been previously deformed and for design purpose the unique
		  value of stiffness given by this curve may be of little
		  significance. Thus it appears that the values of
		  stress—strain properties determined after
		  “conditioning” cycles of deformation would be of more
		  practical use than the unique value obtained in the
		  conventional test. In recent years much interest has been
		  shown in the factors responsible for this softening
		  behavior particularly in regard to the implications of the
		  loss of the stiffening action of reinforcing fillers on the
		  mechanism of reinforcement.}",

		  we expect the material properties to vary with porosity and
		  hence with the density. Such bodies whose properties depend
		  on the density cannot be described by the classical
		  linearized elastic constitutive relation when they are
		  undergoing small deformations, as the material moduli
		  cannot depend on density. A constitutive relation which is
		  valid in the small displacement gradient range wherein the
		  material moduli are dependent on the density can be
		  developed by linearizing implicit constitutive relations
		  for describing elastic bodies introduced recently by
		  Rajagopal [1]. In this paper, we determine the stress
		  concentration due to a hole in a slab that is subject to
		  biaxial loading in a body described by such a constitutive
		  relation. We find that the stress concentration can be much
		  as 147\% higher than that for classical linearized
		  elasticity for the range of loadings considered in
		  the study.},

		  fact most materials are porous. This would then imply that
		  their properties depend on the density. In this report, we
		  develop a constitutive relation to describe the response of
		  elastic bodies that are linear in both the stress and the
		  linearized strain with the material moduli depending on the
		  density. Such a model is not possible within the context of
		  the classical theory of linearized elasticity but is
		  possible within the context of the implicit theory for

		  relations discussed in this paper can be useful to describe
		  the response of porous elastic bodies in the small
		  displacement gradient regime. Using these constitutive
		  relations, we study the stress concentration due to the

		  extension. We find that the stress concentration factor can
		  be significantly different from that in the case of the

		  considering the nonlinearity of the mechanical behavior of
		  asphalt binders for accurately estimating their performance
		  under field conditions, and for comparing and ranking them
		  accordingly. To do so, it is necessary to have a robust and
		  reliable nonlinear viscoelastic theory and a model derived
		  under its purview that can describe the mechanical response
		  of asphalt binders reasonably well. The objective of this
		  study is to develop such a model. A new
		  Gibbs-potential–based thermodynamic framework is used for
		  this purpose. The model developed in this paper is a
		  generalization of the Oldroyd-B model. It is used
		  successfully to describe results of several experiments
		  from the literature concerning the nonlinear response of
		  asphalt binders, including nonlinear creep-recovery and
		  stress-relaxation behavior, thinning behavior, and the
		  appearance of normal forces perpendicular to the plane of

		  It presents a systematic exposition of several aspects of

		  functional analysis in which differentials play an
		  important role. Differential splays at least three
		  significant roles in the theory and application of
		  nonlinear functional analysis. The first and the most
		  familiar role is that of local approximation of a nonlinear
		  map by a linear one. The differential is also important as
		  a tool in nonlinear functional analysis. The third role of
		  the differential is in the clue it provides for
		  generalizations of a certain class of differentiable
		  operators. The theory of differentiation in linear
		  topological spaces is fairly complete for practical

  abstract	= { An introduction to both automatic differentiation and
		  object-oriented programming can enrich a numerical analysis
		  course that typically incorporates numerical
		  differentiation and basic MATLAB computation. Automatic
		  differentiation consists of exact algorithms on
		  floating-point arguments. This implementation overloads
		  standard elementary operators and functions in MATLAB with
		  a derivative rule in addition to the function value; for
		  example, \$\sin u\$ will also compute \$(\cos u)\ast
		  u^{\prime}\$, where u and \$u^{\prime }\$ are numerical
		  values. These methods are mostly one-line programs that
		  operate on a class of value-and-derivative objects,
		  providing a simple example of object-oriented programming
		  in MATLAB using the new (as of release 2008a) class
		  definition structure. The resulting powerful tool computes
		  derivative values and multivariable gradients, and is
		  applied to Newton's method for root-finding in both single
		  and multivariable settings. To compute higher-order
		  derivatives of a single-variable function, another class of
		  series objects keeps Taylor polynomial coefficients up to
		  some order. Overloading multiplication on series objects is
		  a combination (discrete convolution) of coefficients. This
		  idea leads to algorithms for other operations and functions
		  on series objects. A survey of more advanced topics in
		  automatic differentiation includes an introduction to the
		  reverse mode (our implementation is forward mode) and
		  considerations in arbitrary-order multivariable series computation. }

  abstract	= "When strain-softening, elastic-plastic materials are
		  loaded into the plastic regime they often exhibit
		  deformations that are localized into small regions at some
		  point in the loading process. This intense localized
		  deformation limits the formability of materials and will
		  often quickly lead to failure with continued loading.
		  Localized deformation is often associated with satisfaction
		  of the classical discontinuous bifurcation criterion. Here
		  we propose that the loss of strong ellipticity criterion
		  should be used in place of the classical discontinuous
		  bifurcation criterion as a necessary condition for
		  localization. The application of the strong ellipticity
		  criterion implies that a bifurcation mode associated with
		  loss of positive definiteness of the symmetric part of the
		  acoustic tensor must be identified rather than a mode
		  associated with the first zero eigenvalue of the acoustic
		  tensor itself. The eigensystem for the symmetric part of
		  the tangent modulus tensor is obtained for several
		  different plasticity models. This eigensystem provides
		  information about deformation modes associated with both
		  diffuse and discontinuous bifurcations. Material
		  properties, boundary conditions and body geometry are all
		  shown to affect the diffuse and localized deformation modes
		  that are generated. Numerous experimental observations of
		  necking and localization in metal specimens subject to
		  various boundary conditions are explained with the proposed
		  approach."

		  in order to simulate the behaviour of misaligned journal
		  bearings lubricated with ERF. The Bingham plastic model is
		  used to described the behaviour of the ERF, when the fluid
		  is in flow mode. It is found that the applied electric
		  field has a substantial influence on the load carrying
		  capacity and the misaligned attitude of the journal
		  bearings. It is concluded that the electric field imposed
		  on the electro-rheological lubricant tends to align the
		  journal in the bearing, making thus the misalignment angle
		  smaller. Thus by changing the electric field it is possible
		  to control the dynamic behaviour of rotor-bearing systems.

  abstract	= { Many attempts have been made to reproduce theoretically
		  the stress–strain curves obtained from experiments on the
		  isothermal deformation of highly elastic ‘rubberlike'
		  materials. The existence of a strain-energy function has
		  usually been postulated, and the simplifications
		  appropriate to the assumptions of isotropy and
		  incompressibility have been exploited. However, the usual
		  practice of writing the strain energy as a function of two
		  independent strain invariants has, in general, the effect
		  of complicating the associated mathematical analysis (this
		  is particularly evident in relation to the calculation of
		  instantaneous moduli of elasticity) and, consequently, the
		  basic elegance and simplicity of isotropic elasticity is
		  sacrificed. Furthermore, recently proposed special forms of
		  the strain-energy function are rather complicated functions
		  of two invariants. The purpose of this paper is, while
		  making full use of the inherent simplicity of isotropic
		  elasticity, to construct a strain-energy function which:
		  (i) provides an adequate representation of the mechanical
		  response of rubberlike solids, and (ii) is simple enough to
		  be amenable to mathematical analysis. A strain-energy
		  function which is a linear combination of strain invariants
		  defined by ϕ(α) = (a1α+a2α+a3α–3)/α is proposed;
		  and the principal stretches a1, a2 and a3 are used as
		  independent variables subject to the incompressibility
		  constraint a1a2 a3 = 1. Principal axes techniques are used
		  where appropriate. An excellent agreement between this
		  theory and the experimental data from simple tension, pure
		  shear and equibiaxial tension tests is demonstrated. It is
		  also shown that the present theory has certain
		  repercussions in respect of the constitutive inequality
		  proposed by Hill (1968a, 1970b). }

  abstract	= {The morphology of porous anodic oxide films formed on
		  aluminium in phosphoric acid electrolytes at constant
		  current density or voltage, and under changing electrical
		  or electrolytic conditions, has been studied quantitatively
		  by electron microscopy. Replicas from film sections and
		  from both film interfaces have been prepared, as well as
		  transmission micrographs of thin films, produced under
		  accurately defined conditions. During formation at constant
		  current density, pore initiation occurs by the merging of
		  locally thickening oxide regions, which seem related to the
		  substructure of the substrate, and the consequent
		  concentration of current into the residual thin areas. The
		  pores grow in diameter and change in number until the
		  steady-state morphology is established. The film barrier
		  layer thickness has been measured directly for the first
		  time. The steady-state barrier-layer thickness, cell
		  diameter and pore diameter are all observed to be directly
		  proportional to the formation voltage. It becomes evident
		  that the barrier-layer thickness, decided largely by an
		  equilibrium established between oxide formation in the
		  barrier-layer and field-assisted dissolution (probably
		  thermally enhanced) at the pore bases, determines the cell
		  and pore sizes by a simple geometrical mechanism. Anion
		  incorporation into the film and its hydrogen-bonded
		  structure play secondary roles to these factors in
		  determining the actual film morphology, although not its
		  subsequent properties. A consequence of the mechanism is
		  that, at constant current density, relatively
		  non-aggressive electrolytes give thicker barrier layers,
		  larger cells and larger pores next to the barrier layer
		  than aggressive media, although subsequent pore widening at
		  the outer surface of the film by simple chemical
		  dissolution is more severe in aggressive electrolytes.},

		  hyperelastic model based on the work of Godunov and
		  Romenski. First, we discuss some general conceptual
		  differences of the two approaches. Second, a detailed study
		  of both models is proposed, where differences are made
		  evident at the aid of deriving a hypoelastic-type model
		  corresponding to the hyperelastic model and a particular
		  equation of state used in this paper. Third, using the same
		  high order ADER Finite Volume and Discontinuous Galerkin
		  methods on fixed and moving unstructured meshes for both
		  models, a wide range of numerical benchmark test problems
		  has been solved. The numerical solutions obtained for the
		  two different models are directly compared with each other.
		  For small elastic deformations, the two models produce very
		  similar solutions that are close to each other. However, if
		  large elastic or elastoplastic deformations occur, the
		  solutions present larger differences.}

  abstract	= {A novel physically based material model is presented that
		  describes the complex stress-strain behavior of filled
		  rubbers under arbitrary deformation histories in a
		  constitutive manner. The polymer response is considered by
		  the extended non-affine tube model. Stress softening is
		  taken into account via the breakdown of highly stressed
		  polymer-filler domains under load and homogenization of the
		  medium. Set stress and hysteresis are introduced via a
		  continuous reformation mechanism, characterized by a single
		  critical stress parameter. The latter is predicted to be
		  dependent on temperature and deformation rate by means of
		  Kramers escape rate. This is confirmed for a wide range of
		  temperatures and speeds by fitting to multihysteresis
		  measurements carried out in a heat chamber. Fitting
		  parameters reveal that the mechanism responsible for
		  hysteresis and set stress takes place on the nanometer
		  scale with energies of roughly 100 kJ/mol. The behavior of
		  the fitting parameters is analyzed for varying filler
		  loadings and crosslinker concentrations in EPDM.
		  Simulations of the stress-strain response for several
		  deformation modes are in good agreement with experiments
		  and its mathematical simplicity makes it very promising for
		  applications with Finite Element Methods (FEM).}

		  history, strain rate and state, temperature and even
		  direction of previous loading. Although there is a
		  plurality of both physical and phenomenological models,
		  only few are able to reproduce this rich spectrum of
		  effects. Moreover, many of them suffer from physical or
		  mathematical inconsistencies. We present a model, which is
		  based on physical ideas and plausible assumptions about the
		  material’s microstructure, while being designed for high
		  efficiency and robustness in finite element applications.
		  It is shown by fits to extensive experimental data that it
		  reproduces almost the full phenomenology of filled rubbers,
		  both at low and high strains, for different deformation
		  states and rates, holding times, and at different
		  temperatures. The main modeling paradigm is the
		  stress-induced breakdown and reorganization of microscopic
		  structures which defines the time-dependent behavior of the
		  material and allows to reproduce logarithmic relaxation
		  effects. Moreover, its nine fit parameters evolve in a
		  physically reasonable way under variation of filler and
		  cross-linker content. A static limiting case of the model
		  is derived, reducing the number of parameters and
		  computational effort wherever necessary. Finally, a
		  FE-implementation using computer-generated subroutines is
		  presented and tested against experimental data of a
		  simplified bushing under torsional, radial, cardanic and
		  axial loading.}

  abstract	= "We propose an innovative procedure by exploiting the
		  physical meaning of natural strain or Lode invariants with
		  the following salient contributions: 1) Uniaxial data for
		  human brain tissue is used to stipulate the mathematical
		  structure of the potential in terms of the Lode invariant
		  that quantifies the magnitude of distortion along with the
		  modulus term being an unknown function of the Lode angle
		  that quantifies the mode or type of distortion. 2) By a
		  priori analysis using the Baker-Ericksen inequalities, the
		  mathematical form of the modulus function is determined in
		  a novel manner. 3) The derived modulus function is
		  corrected by adding a constant, which in turn is determined
		  using analysis involving sufficient conditions of the
		  stronger Hill inequality. 4) In addition, we also prove
		  that any potential that satisfies Hill inequality also
		  satisfies true-stress-true-strain monotonicity condition in
		  plane stress. Compared to Mihai-Ogden model, besides
		  excellent quantitative agreement with data for human brain
		  tissue (see Mihai et al., 2017), the constructed model
		  also emulates the observed non-linear behavior of shear
		  stress with respect to the amount of shear as opposed to
		  the nearly linear response predicted by the antecedent
		  model. Additionally, when only tension-compression data is
		  available for determining material parameters, the
		  predicted combined tension and shear response associated
		  with the proposed constitutive relation shows monotone
		  decreasing Poynting stress (compressive), while the former
		  predicts an unexpected non-monotone response for certain
		  levels of tension."

		  mathematical pendulum with an oscillating pivot. This
		  simple mechanical setting is frequently used as the prime
		  example of a system exhibiting the parametric resonance
		  phenomenon, which manifests itself by surprising
		  stabilisation/destabilisation effects. In the classical
		  case the pivot oscillations are described by a cosine wave,
		  and the corresponding stability analysis requires one to
		  investigate the behaviour of solutions to the Mathieu
		  equation. This is not a straightforward procedure, and it
		  does not lead to exact and simple analytical results
		  expressed in terms of elementary functions. Consequently,
		  the explanation of the parametric resonance phenomenon can
		  be in this case obscured by the relatively involved
		  technical calculations. We show that the stability analysis
		  is much easier if one considers the pivot motion described
		  by a non-smooth function—a triangular or a nearly
		  rectangular wave. The non-smooth pivot motion leads to the
		  presence of singularities (Dirac distributions) in the
		  corresponding Mathieu type equation, which seemingly
		  further complicates the analysis. Fortunately, this is only
		  a minor technical difficulty. Once the mathematical setting
		  for the non-smooth forcing is settled down, the
		  corresponding stability diagram is indeed straightforward
		  to obtain, and the stability boundaries are, unlike in the
		  classical case, given in terms of simple analytical
		  formulae involving only elementary functions.}

		  and provides high accuracy and computational efficiency.
		  Accuracy and stability of the method are thoroughly tested
		  for the model problem of transitional and turbulent flows
		  in an infinite circular pipe. Verification of the algorithm
		  includes two issues. First, spectral characteristics of the
		  Hagen–Poiseuille flow stability problem are compared with
		  those of the discrete linearized Navier–Stokes operator.
		  Secondly, the results of direct Navier–Stokes simulation
		  of all stages of laminar-turbulent transition in a circular
		  pipe at Reynolds number of 4000 are presented. Time
		  evolution of finite-amplitude disturbances of laminar flow
		  was calculated until the statistically stationary turbulent
		  flow regime was established. In addition to common
		  statistical analysis, the possibility of turbulence
		  description by means of velocity fields having certain
		  symmetries is examined. Thus, the algorithm presented seems
		  to be a ready-to-use robust tool for accurate investigation
		  and further parametric studies of both transition
		  mechanisms and fully developed turbulent flow regimes. "

		  virtue of the mechanisms used to store energy and produce
		  entropy. Usually, the energy storage properties of such

		  for elastic solids have been successfully developed by
		  appealing to implicit constitutive relations, and these new
		  models offer a different perspective to the old topic of
		  the elastic response of materials. In particular, a
		  sub-class of implicit constitutive relations, namely
		  relations wherein the left Cauchy–Green tensor is
		  expressed as a function of stress, is of interest. We show
		  how to use this new perspective in the development of
		  mathematical models for viscoelastic fluids, and we provide
		  a discussion of the thermodynamic underpinnings of such
		  models. We focus on the use of Gibbs free energy instead of
		  Helmholtz free energy, and using the standard
		  Giesekus/Oldroyd-B models, we show how the alternative
		  approach works in the case of well-known models. The

		  in a mapping of the macroscopic deformation to the

		  from the strain energy of the soft domain and thus evolves
		  as the volume fraction of soft domain evolves with

		  extension with the experimental data of Mullins and Tobin
		  show the efficacy of the model and suggest that an
		  evolution in the underlying soft/hard domain microstructure
		  of the elastomer captures the fundamental features of
		  stretch-induced softening. Model simulations of the cyclic

		  strain with the material moduli depending nonlinearly on

		  shearing motion at second order, when considering weakly
		  nonlinear waves, that only occurs at third order within the
		  case of the classical nonlinear Cauchy elasticity theory.
		  Linearization of the constitutive relation under the
		  assumption of small displacement gradient reduces the
		  constitutive relation to one whose material moduli can
		  depend on the trace of the linearized strain and hence the
		  density in virtue of the balance of mass, such a feature is
		  not possible within the context of the Blatz-Ko
		  constitutive relation, or for that matter any Cauchy

		  inelastic response of materials. Part I (see Rajagopal and
		  Srinivasa, 1998 International Journal of Plasticity 14,
		  945–967) dealt with the structure of the constitutive
		  equations for the elastic response of a material with
		  multiple natural configurations. We now focus attention on
		  the evolution of the natural configurations. We introduce
		  two functions-the Helmholtz potential and the rate of
		  dissipation function—representing the rate of conversion
		  of mechanical work into heat. Motivated by, and
		  generalizing the work of Ziegler (1963) in Progress in
		  Solid Mechanics, Vol. 4, North-Holland, Amsterdam/New York;
		  (1983) An Introduction to Thermodynamics, North-Holland,
		  Amsterdam/New York) we then assume that the evolution of
		  the natural configurations occurs in such a way that the
		  rate of dissipation is maximized. This maximization is
		  subject to the constraint that the rate of dissipation is
		  equal to the difference between the rate of mechanical
		  working and the rate of increase of the Helmholtz potential
		  per unit volume. This then allows us to derive the
		  constitutive equations for the stress response and the
		  evolution of the natural configurations from these two
		  scalar functions. Of course, the maximum rate of
		  dissipation criterion that is stated here is only an
		  assumption that holds for a certain class of materials
		  under consideration. Our quest is to see whether such an
		  assumption gives reasonable results. In the process, we
		  hope to gain insight into the nature of such materials. We
		  demonstrate that the resulting constitutive equations allow
		  for response with and without yielding behavior and obtain
		  a generalization of the normality and convexity conditions.
		  We also show that, in the limit of quasistatic
		  deformations, if one considers materials that possess
		  yielding behavior, then the constitutive equations reduce
		  to those corresponding to the strain space formulation of
		  the rate independent theory of plasticity (see e.g. Naghdi
		  (1990) Journal of Applied Mathematics and Physics A345,
		  425–458.). Moreover, in this limit, the maximum rate of
		  dissipation criterion, as stated here, is equivalent to the
		  work inequality of Naghdi and Trapp (1975) Quartely Journal
		  of Mechanics and Applied Mathematics 28, 25–46). The main
		  results together with an illustrative example are
		  presented. "

		  provide a framework to describe the mechanics of such

		  describing a variety of responses and has been used to
		  describe traditional metal plasticity, twinning,
		  traditional viscoelasticity of both solids and fluids,
		  solid-to-solid phase transitions, polymer crystallization,
		  response of multi-network polymers, and anisotropic
		  liquids. The classical theories of elastic solids and

		  usually described by means of statistical mechanics. In
		  particular, the Neo-Hooke model has been derived in this
		  fashion. The micromechanical modelling can be extended to
		  include also the breaking and reforming of chains. One
		  possible approach at this level is the so-called transient
		  network theory. Using certain assumptions for the chain
		  distributions, one arrives at a continuum mechanical model
		  of finite viscoelasticity which is based on the
		  multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient.
		  This means that the inelastic part of the deformation is
		  regarded as an elastic isomorphism. Further, the
		  considerations at the micro level give information about
		  the temperature dependence of the mechanical material
		  parameters. For instance, it can be shown easily that the
		  shear modulus depends approximately linearly on the
		  temperature. This fact has important consequences for
		  thermo-mechanical coupling which have not yet been
		  discussed in detail in the literature.}

		  particular choice of the two modes was inspired by models
		  originally developed to describe the response of asphalt

		  experimental data obtained from a modified stress
		  relaxation experiment in the torsional configuration of the

		  parameters for each model is achieved by minimising the
		  weighted least-squares distance between experimental

		  a tree-structured Parzen estimator algorithm to find an
		  initial guess, followed by further optimisation using the
		  Nelder–Mead simplex algorithm. The results show that the

		  the most suitable variant to describe the observed

  abstract	= {{Embryos of different species of vertebrate share a common
		  organisation and often look similar. Adult differences
		  among species become more apparent through divergence at
		  later stages. Some authors have suggested that members of
		  most or all vertebrate clades pass through a virtually
		  identical, conserved stage. This idea was promoted by
		  Haeckel, and has recently been revived in the context of
		  claims regarding the universality of developmental
		  mechanisms. Thus embryonic resemblance at the tailbud stage
		  has been linked with a conserved pattern of developmental
		  gene expression - the zootype. Haeckel's drawings of the
		  external morphology of various vertebrates remain the most
		  comprehensive comparative data purporting to show a
		  conserved stage. However, their accuracy has been
		  questioned and only a narrow range of species was
		  illustrated. In view of the current widespread interest in
		  evolutionary developmental tal biology, and especially in
		  the conservation of developmental mechanisms,
		  re-examination of the extent of variation in vertebrate
		  embryos is long overdue, We present here the first review
		  of the external morphology of tailbud embryos, illustrated
		  with original specimens from a wide range of vertebrate
		  groups, We find that embryos at the tailbud stage - thought
		  to correspond to a conserved stage - show variations in
		  form due to allometry, heterochrony, and differences in
		  body plan and somite number. These variations foreshadow
		  important differences in adult body form. Contrary to
		  recent claims that all vertebrate embryos pass through a
		  stage when they are the same size, we find a greater than
		  10-fold variation in greatest length at the tailbud stage.
		  Our survey seriously undermines the credibility of
		  Haeckel's drawings, which depict not a conserved stage for
		  vertebrates, but a stylised amniote embryo. In fact, the
		  taxonomic level of greatest resemblance among vertebrate
		  embryos is below the subphylum. The wide variation in
		  morphology among vertebrate embryos is difficult to
		  reconcile with the idea of a phyogenetically-conserved
		  tailbud stage, and suggests that at least some
		  developmental mechanisms are not highly constrained by the
		  zootype, Our study also highlights the dangers of drawing
		  general conclusions about vertebrate development from
		  studies of gene expression in a small number of laboratory
		  species.}},

		  This controversy has major implications for evolutionary

		  addressed the issue with his Biogenetic Law, and his embryo
		  drawings functioned as supporting data. We re-examine
		  Haeckel's work and its significance for modern efforts to
		  develop a rigorous comparative framework for developmental
		  studies. Haeckel's comparative embryology was evolutionary
		  but non-quantitative. It was based on developmental
		  sequences, and treated heterochrony as a sequence change.
		  It is not always clear whether he believed in
		  recapitulation of single characters or entire stages. The
		  Biogenetic Law is supported by several recent studies - if
		  applied to single characters only. Haeckel's important but
		  overlooked alphabetical analogy of evolution and
		  development is an advance on von Baer. Haeckel recognized
		  the evolutionary diversity in early embryonic stages, in
		  line with modern thinking. He did not necessarily advocate
		  the strict form of recapitulation and terminal addition
		  commonly attributed to him. Haeckel's much-criticized
		  embryo drawings are important as phylogenetic hypotheses,
		  teaching aids, and evidence for evolution. While some
		  criticisms of the drawings are legitimate, others are more
		  tendentious. In opposition to Haeckel and his embryo
		  drawings, Wilhelm His made major advances towards
		  developing a quantitative comparative embryology based on
		  morphometrics. Unfortunately His's work in this area is
		  largely forgotten. Despite his obvious flaws, Haeckel can
		  be seen as the father of a sequence-based phylogenetic
		  embryology.},

		  embryology. It is now important to be able to compare gene
		  expression in different species at similar developmental
		  stages. One phenomenon which may make it difficult to
		  compare embryos in this way is heterochrony-a change in
		  developmental timing during evolution. It is not clear
		  whether heterochrony can affect the intermediate stages of
		  embryonic development, when many important genes involved
		  in pattern formation are expressed. A prevalent view is
		  that these so-called phylotypic stages are resistant to
		  evolutionary change because they are when the body plan is
		  laid down. Haeckel's famous drawings, which show different
		  vertebrates developing from virtually identical
		  somite-stage embryos, are still used to support this idea.
		  I have reexamined the morphological data relating to
		  developmental timing in somite-stage embryos. The data
		  reveal striking patterns of heterochrony during vertebrate
		  evolution. These shifts in developmental timing have
		  strongly affected the phylotypic stage, which is therefore
		  poorly conserved and is more appropriately described as the
		  phylotypic period. This is contrary to the impression
		  created by Haeckel's drawings, which I show to be
		  inaccurate and misleading. The study of gene expression in
		  embryos which shown heterochrony could give important
		  insights into evolutionary and developmental mechanisms.

		  load-deformation curves obtained for certain simple types
		  of deformation of vulcanized rubber test-pieces in terms of
		  a single stored-energy function. The types of experiment
		  described are: (i) the pure homogeneous deformation of a

		  such a manner that one of the invariants of the strain, I1

		  maintained at unity, while the other is varied); (iii)
		  simultaneous simple extension and pure shear of a thin
		  sheet (i.e. pure homogeneous deformation in which one of

		  material, under the action of three pairs of equal and
		  oppositely directed forces f1,f2,f3, applied normally to,
		  and uniformly distributed over, pairs of parallel faces of
		  the cube, is studied. It is assumed that the only possible
		  equilibrium states are states of pure, homogeneous
		  deformation. It is found that (1) when the stress
		  components in the deformed cube are specified, the
		  corresponding equilibrium state is uniquely determined
		  (this is shown in section 6 of Part I). (2) When the three
		  pairs of equal and oppositely directed forces f1,f2 and f3
		  are specified, (a) the corresponding equilibrium state is
		  uniquely determined, provided that one or more of the
		  forces f1,f2 and f3 is negative, i.e. is a compressional
		  force, or, if they are all positive, provided that f1f2f3 <
		  (1/3E)3, where 1/3E is the constant of proportionality
		  between the stress and strain components (analogous to the
		  rigidity modulus of the classical theory of small elastic
		  deformations of isotropic materials). (b) If f1,f2 and f3
		  are all positive and f1f2f3 > (1/3E)3, then the equilibrium
		  state is not necessarily uniquely determined. The number of
		  equilibrium states which exist depends on the values of
		  f1,f2,f3 and 1/3E. The actual state of deformation which is
		  obtained depends in general on the order in which the
		  forces are applied. In the cases (1) and (2a), it is shown
		  that the unique equilibrium state is one of stable
		  equilibrium. In case (2b), it is shown that the possible
		  equilibrium states are of eight different types. Two of
		  these are mutually exclusive. Of these eight types of
		  equilibrium state, four are inherently unstable. Of the
		  other four types, one is inherently stable. The three
		  remaining types of equilibrium state are not necessarily
		  unique; i.e. more than one equilibrium state of each type
		  may correspond to specified values of f1,f2 and f3.
		  However, if one or more equilibrium states of a particular
		  type exists, then at least one of them is stable. If f1 =
		  f2 = f3 = f, then there is a unique state of stable
		  equilibrium, provided that f < 1/3E. If 1/3E < f <
		  (1/4)1/3E, then there are three states of stable
		  equilibrium, none of which is identical with the undeformed
		  state of the cube. If (1/4)1/3E < f < 2/3E, there are four
		  states of stable equilibrium, one of which is identical
		  with the undeformed state of the cube. If f > 2/3E, then
		  there is only one state of stable equilibrium, and this is
		  identical with the undeformed state of the cube.},

		  invariants, has its edges parallel to the axes x, y and z
		  of a rectangular Cartesian co-ordinate system. It can be
		  bent so that: (i) every plane, initially normal to the

		  whose axis is the z-axis; (ii) every plane, initially
		  normal to the y-axis, becomes a plane containing the

		  initially normal to the x-axis are uniform over each of

		  some of the plastic work into heat. The remainder
		  contributes to the stored energy of cold work due to the
		  creation of crystal defects. This paper is concerned with
		  the fraction β of the rate of plastic work converted into
		  heating. We examine the status of the common assumption
		  that β is a constant with regard to the thermodynamic
		  foundations of thermoplasticity and experiments. A general
		  internal-variable theory is introduced and restricted to
		  abide by the second law of thermodynamics. Experimentally
		  motivated assumptions reduce this theory to a special model
		  of classical thermoplasticity. The only part of the
		  internal energy not determined from the isothermal response
		  is the stored energy of cold work, a function only of the
		  internal variables. We show that this function can be
		  inferred from stress and temperature data from a single
		  adiabatic straining experiment. Experimental data from
		  dynamic Kolsky-bar tests at various strain rates yield a
		  unique stored energy function. Its knowledge is crucial for
		  the determination of the thermomechanical response in
		  non-isothermal processes. Such a prediction agrees well
		  with results from dynamic tests at different rates. In
		  these experiments, β is found to depend strongly on both
		  strain and strain rate for various engineering materials.
		  The model is successful in predicting this dependence.
		  Requiring β to be constant is thus an approximation of
		  dubious validity.}

		  continuous coefficients. This algebraic characterization,

		  suspension is exposed to a strong electric field the
		  effective viscosity increases dramatically. In this paper
		  we first derive a model which captures this behaviour. For
		  the resulting system of equations we then prove local in
		  time existence of strong solutions for large data. For
		  these solutions we finally derive error estimates for a
		  fully implicit time-discretization.}",

  abstract	= {A new brittle-elastoviscoplastic (BEVP) fluid model is
		  presented in this paper. This model is relatively simple to
		  use, as it contains few material parameters and a simple
		  fixed-point algorithm is effective for solving the coupled
		  system of equations. The model combines some existing
		  fundamental features such as elasticity, plasticity and
		  brittle damage. The combination of them is based on
		  thermodynamics that ensures the positivity of the
		  dissipation and the Onsager symmetry. Moreover,
		  thermodynamics allows to point out the link between
		  thixotropy and damage in the context of elastoviscoplastic
		  (EVP) fluids. Theoretical results on the Drucker–Prager
		  plasticity criterion are completed in order to use it here.
		  Preliminary results with the proposed BEVP model are very
		  encouraging: it is able to represent the pre-failure,
		  failure and post-failure behavior of quasi-brittle
		  materials.}

		  Stress in the reference configuration evolves with time to

		  constitutive prescriptions are made to model the

		  an isotropic inhomogeneous compressible annular right

		  that appeal to an equivalence in the stored energies could
		  lead to serious errors in the estimate for stresses in a
		  inhomogeneous body as stresses depend on the derivatives of
		  the stored energy with respect to the deformation gradient.
		  This is a serious drawback as many a time failures are
		  determined by the stresses. The study demonstrates that, in
		  particular, great caution should be exercised in
		  homogenization, especially if an inhomogeneous body is to
		  be approximated by a homogeneous body belonging to the same
		  class. Comparison of local measures, such as stresses,
		  reveal that their values in the case of the inhomogeneous
		  body and its homogeneous counterpart can be both
		  qualitatively and quantitatively far apart. Even the
		  differences in global measures like the axial load, torque,
		  etc., are found to be significant between the inhomogeneous
		  body and its homogeneous counterpart. It is also shown that
		  the material parameters characterizing the homogenous
		  approximation gleaned from correlations from different
		  experiments, performed on the same inhomogeneous body, can
		  be quite different. }

		  history of the polymer. This conformation hysteresis
		  persists for many polymer relaxation times and is due to
		  conformation-dependent hydrodynamic forces. Polymer
		  conformational free-energy landscapes were calculated from

  abstract	= { There are some materials in nature that experience
		  deformations that are not elastic. Viscoelastic materials
		  are some of them. We come across many such materials in our
		  daily lives through a number of interesting applications in
		  engineering, material science and medicine. This article
		  concerns itself with modelling of the nonlinear response of
		  a class of viscoelastic solids. In particular, nonlinear
		  viscoelasticity of strain rate type, which can be described
		  by a constitutive relation for the stress function
		  depending not only on the strain but also on the strain
		  rate, is considered. This particular case is not only
		  favourable from a mathematical analysis point of view but
		  also due to experimental observations, knowledge of the
		  strain rate sensitivity of viscoelastic properties is
		  crucial for accurate predictions of the mechanical
		  behaviour of solids in different areas of applications.
		  First, a brief introduction of some basic terminology and
		  preliminaries, including kinematics, material
		  frame-indifference and thermodynamics, is given. Then,
		  considering the governing equations with constitutive
		  relationships between the stress and the strain for the
		  modelling of nonlinear viscoelasticity of strain rate type,
		  the most general model of interest is obtained. Then, the
		  long-term behaviour of solutions is discussed. Finally,
		  some applications of the model are presented. }

  abstract	= "Classical invariants, despite that most of them have an
		  unclear physical interpretation and not having experimental
		  advantages, have been extensively used in modeling
		  nonlinear transversely isotropic soft tissue. In this
		  paper, a new set of spectral invariants that has some
		  advantages over classical invariants, is proposed to model
		  the behaviour of transversely isotropic soft tissue
		  materials. With the aid of the proposed spectral invariant
		  formulation, which is shown to be more general, it is
		  possible to study, in a much simpler manner, the effect of
		  different types of deformations on the response of the
		  material. The proposed strain energy function which
		  contains single variable principal stretch functions is
		  useful in facilitating an experiment to obtain a specific
		  constitutive equation for a particular type of materials.
		  The explicit appearance of the classical ground state
		  constants in the constitutive equation simplifies the
		  calculation for their admissible values. A crude specific
		  constitutive model is proposed for soft tissue and the
		  model fits reasonably well with existing simple shear,
		  biaxial and uniaxial experimental data and managed to
		  predict several sets of experimental data."

		  review is to highlight the relationship between the
		  theories of viscoelasticity and of elasticity, and to
		  leverage this connection in contemporary soft matter
		  problems. We review the principles governing models for
		  viscoelastic liquids, for example solutions of flexible
		  polymers. Such materials are characterized by a relaxation
		  time λ, over which stresses relax. We recall the
		  kinematics and elastic response of large deformations, and
		  show which polymer models do (and which do not) correspond
		  to a nonlinear elastic solid in the limit λ → ∞.
		  With this insight, we split the work done by elastic
		  stresses into reversible and dissipative parts, and
		  establish the general form of the conservation law for the
		  total energy. The elastic correspondence can offer an
		  insightful tool for a broad class of problems; as an

		  anelastic deformation of ice and also equations which model
		  conductive heat transfer in the ice shell. We find that
		  tidal heating is concentrated in a narrow low viscosity
		  zone near the base of the ice shell and along faults.
		  Outside the SPR, the thickness of this zone is about 1/10
		  of the local ice thickness and the associated volumetric
		  heating is ≲10−6 W/m3, corresponding to less than
		  1 GW of dissipated power. In the SPR, the tidal effects
		  are enhanced by the combined action of faults and ice shell
		  thinning. Although the volumetric heating in this
		  relatively small region may be larger than 10−4 W/m3,
		  the total heat production in this region does not exceed
		  1.1 GW. Our computations show that tidal heating in the
		  ice shell can explain only a small fraction of Enceladus'
		  heat production derived from astrometric observations,
		  implying that Enceladus' heat engine is powered by
		  dissipation in the core or in the ocean."

  abstract	= {A thermodynamic framework has been developed for a class
		  of amorphous polymers used in fused deposition modeling
		  (FDM), in order to predict the residual stresses and the
		  accompanying distortion of the geometry of the printed part
		  (warping). When a polymeric melt is cooled, the
		  inhomogeneous distribution of temperature causes spatially
		  varying volumetric shrinkage resulting in the generation of
		  residual stresses. Shrinkage is incorporated into the
		  framework by introducing an isotropic volumetric
		  expansion/contraction in the kinematics of the body. We
		  show that the parameter for shrinkage also appears in the
		  systematically derived rate-type constitutive relation for
		  the stress. The solidification of the melt around the glass
		  transition temperature is emulated by drastically
		  increasing the viscosity of the melt. In order to
		  illustrate the usefulness and efficacy of the constitutive
		  relation that has been developed, we consider four ribbons
		  of polymeric melt stacked on top of each other such as
		  those extruded using a flat nozzle: each layer laid
		  instantaneously and allowed to cool for one second before
		  another layer is laid on it. Each layer cools, shrinks and
		  warps until a new layer is laid, at which time the heat
		  from the newly laid layer flows into the previous laid
		  layer and heats up the bottom layers. The residual stresses
		  of the existing and newly laid layers readjust to satisfy
		  equilibrium. Such mechanical and thermal interactions
		  amongst layers result in a complex distribution of residual
		  stresses. The plane strain approximation predicts nearly
		  equibiaxial tensile stress conditions in the core region of
		  the solidified part, implying that a preexisting crack in
		  that region is likely to propagate and cause failure of the
		  part during service. The free-end of the interface between
		  the first and the second layer is subjected to the largest
		  magnitude of combined shear and tension in the plane with a
		  propensity for delamination.}

		  of constitutive equations that are applicable to isotropic
		  inelastic materials with large elastic and plastic strains
		  using the multiconfigurational framework (Rajagopal, K.R.,
		  Srinivasa, A.R. Int. J. Plasticity 14 (1998) 945;
		  Rajagopal, K.R., Srinivasa, A.R. Int. J. Plasticity 14
		  (1998), 948), in such a way as to generalize the central
		  ideas (such as isotropy, constant elastic modulii,
		  quadratic yield surfaces and non-hardening behavior) of the
		  Prandtl–Reuss theory to finite deformations, (2) to
		  examine the consequences of using a physically plausible
		  criterion of maximum rate of mechanical dissipation, (3) to
		  examine the relationship of the resulting models to the
		  classical Prandtl–Reuss theory as well as other possible
		  formulations (specifically those that rely on the use of a
		  maximum plastic work postulate), and (4) to consider the
		  effect of finite elastic strains on the response of the
		  material subject to some simple homogenous deformations. By
		  considering the response under simple shear, it is shown
		  that the elastic-plastic counterpart of the well known
		  Poynting effect in finite elasticity has a profound
		  influence on the post-yield behavior of such materials. In
		  particular, it is shown that this gives rise to a strain
		  softening effect even though the overall response is that
		  of a non-hardening material."

		  anisotropic Green elastic materials. Using this
		  decomposition (in which the upper triangular matrix is
		  related to the Cholesky factorization of the Cauchy Green
		  stretch tensor C), in lieu of the traditional polar
		  decomposition, provides significant advantages: (1) the
		  decomposition is very simple, fast and widely implemented
		  in every major linear algebra package and does not require
		  knowledge of eigenvalues. (2) The factorization allows us
		  to decompose the total deformation into a sequence of
		  simple, physically visualizable, meaningful elementary
		  deformations. (3) It provides a remarkably simple
		  representation of the stress response in terms of the
		  derivatives of the strain energy (see Eqs. (26), (27),
		  (28)) especially for anisotropic materials. (4) It provides
		  a unified and simple way of considering triclinic,
		  monoclinic, orthorhombic, and transversely isotropic
		  materials and satisfies the “orthogonality” criterion
		  described by Criscione (2005) in order to minimize
		  experimental error propagation. The results, which were
		  inspired by and are closely related to the developments by
		  Criscione et al., 2001, Criscione and Hunter, 2003 and
		  follows many of their ideas, are in a much simpler and
		  computationally tractable form than that given by Criscione
		  and coworkers while retaining every desirable feature of

		  shear rheological tests are carried out on deep-sea
		  sediments substitute at different shear rates. These
		  substitute samples are prepared by mixing bentonite with
		  water based on the in-situ vane shear strength of deep-sea
		  sediments. A compressible viscoelastic fluid model is
		  formulated based on the thermodynamic framework developed
		  by Rajagopal and Srinivasa (2000) to describe the
		  experimental response of bentonite–water mixture.
		  Experimental responses indicate that the effects of slip
		  are significant in the shear rheometry of bentonite–water
		  mixture. Hence a slip model is proposed, which relates the
		  shear stress to slip velocity at the wall and the imposed
		  shear rate values. The slip boundary conditions coupled
		  with the viscoelastic model is validated using experimental
		  data and is observed to be in good agreement. Further, the
		  influence of shear rate on interfacial slip has been
		  numerically analyzed and slip effects are found to be
		  significant in defining rheological behavior with

		  of time-dependent viscoelastic flow calculations. The
		  channel Poiseuille flow at Re ⪢ 1 and O(1) We is chosen
		  as a test problem. Through a linear stability analysis, we
		  demonstrate that the introduction of a small amount of
		  (dimensionless) diffusivity, typically of the order 10−3,
		  does not affect the critical eigenmodes of the viscoelastic
		  Orr-Sommerfeld problem appreciably. However, a diffusive
		  term of that magnitude is shown to have a significant
		  influence on the singular eigenmodes of the classical
		  Oldroyd-B model, associated with the continuum spectra. A
		  finite amplitude perturbation is constructed as a linear
		  superposition of the eigenvectors corresponding to the most
		  unstable eigenvalues of the problem. This is superimposed
		  on the steady Poiseuille flow solution to provide the
		  initial conditions for time-dependent simulations. The
		  numerical algorithm involves a fully spectral spatial
		  discretization and a semi-implicit second order integration
		  in time. For the Oldroyd-B fluid, depending on the
		  magnitude of the initial perturbation, numerical
		  instabilities set in at relatively short times while the
		  components of the conformation tensor increase
		  monotonically in magnitude with time. Introduction of a
		  diffusive term into this model is shown to stabilize the
		  calculations remarkably, and for a three-dimensional
		  simulation with Re = 5000 and We = 1, no instabilities were
		  observed even at very large times. The effect of the
		  magnitude of the diffusivity on the stability and the flow
		  dynamics is addressed through a direct comparison of the
		  results with those obtained for the Oldroyd-B model."

  abstract	= "This paper presents a comprehensive review of the various
		  methods employed to study the static, dynamic and stability
		  behavior of Functionally Graded Material (FGM) plates. Both
		  analytical and numerical methods are considered. The review
		  is carried out with an emphasis to present stress,
		  vibration and buckling characteristics of FGM plates
		  predicted using different theories proposed by several
		  researchers without considering the detailed mathematical
		  implication of various methodologies. The effect of
		  variation of material properties through the thickness,
		  type of load case, boundary conditions, edge ratio,
		  side-to-thickness ratio and the effect of nonlinearity on
		  the behavior of FGM plates are discussed. The main
		  objective of this paper is to serve the interests of
		  researchers and engineers already involved in the analysis
		  and design of FGM structures."

		  paper compares five stress rates: Jaumann's, Truesdell's,
		  Green-Naghdi's, Sowerby-Chu's and Durban-Baruch's, for
		  simple shear. Elastic, elastic-perfectly plastic and
		  elastic-plastic hardening (isotropic, kinematic, and
		  combined) material models are considered. Different
		  solutions have already been published for these cases,

		  Using the new derivation rule the new rate form of the
		  hyperelastic Doyle-Ericksen formula is obtained. Taking
		  advantage of the Sowerby-Chu stress rate a new constitutive
		  equation for hypoelastic material is given."

		  optical properties{,} is widely used as a filler
		  incorporated into different hosting materials
		  (elastomers{,} plastics{,} and hydrogels) to improve their
		  mechanical properties. In this work{,} we used in situ free
		  radical polymerization to synthesize polyacrylamide
		  (PAAm)/GO hybrid NC gels in the presence of GO nanosheets
		  and a very small amount of chemical cross-linkers
		  (N{,}N′-methylenebisacrylamide{,} MBA < 0.1 mol\%). By
		  optimizing GO and MBA concentrations{,} the resulting
		  PAAm/GO gels can achieve an elastic modulus of 66 kPa{,} a
		  fracture stress of 0.27 MPa{,} a fracture strain of 13.76
		  mm mm−1{,} deformed energy of 2.52 MJ m−3{,} and
		  tearing energy of 964 J m−2. Due to the presence of
		  physical interactions between PAAm and GO nanosheets{,}
		  PAAm/GO gels demonstrate λ-dependent energy dissipation
		  and Mullins self-recovery behaviors. The gels can rapidly
		  recover their stiffness and toughness by 76\% and 60\%{,}
		  respectively{,} after 30 min of resting at room
		  temperature. The possible toughening mechanisms and Mullins
		  effects of PAAm/GO gels were proposed and compared with
		  those of filler rubbers and other high strength hydrogels.
		  This work provides new viewpoints to develop tough
		  hydrogels by the introduction of GO into other hydrogels
		  with a good mechanical balance between strong chemical
		  bonding and reversible physical bonding."

		  the oscillatory method developed by Mather, Pearson, and
		  Burghardt in 1995. The single-component results are
		  compared with a molecular theory derived in 1995 by Archer
		  and Larson as well as Kr{\"o}ger and Sellers, which
		  predicts the temperature dependence of $\lambda$, while the
		  results from the binary mixtures are compared to a
		  continuum theory derived by Rey in 1996, giving the
		  concentration dependence of $\lambda$. The results from the
		  four experimental methods agree with each other for
		  single-component liquid crystals, but not for mixtures.
		  This suggests a failure of the single director
		  Leslie-Ericksen theory to describe the rheology of liquid
		  crystal mixtures.",

		  Seven-line MATLAB codes are presented that implement both
		  methods, and experiments show that the supposed factor-of-2
		  advantage of Gauss quadrature is rarely realized. Theorems
		  are given to explain this effect. First, following O'Hara
		  and Smith in the 1960s, the phenomenon is explained as a
		  consequence of aliasing of coefficients in Chebyshev
		  expansions. Then another explanation is offered based on
		  the interpretation of a quadrature formula as a rational
		  approximation of \$\log((z+1)/(z-1))\$ in the complex
		  plane. Gauss quadrature corresponds to Padé approximation
		  at \$z=\infty\$. Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature corresponds
		  to an approximation whose order of accuracy at \$z=\infty\$
		  is only half as high, but which is nevertheless equally
		  accurate near \$[-1,1]\$. }

		  biodegradable copolymers suture threads requires the
		  analysis of their response under cyclic loading and the
		  prediction of the fundamental damage and residual stretches
		  effects. In this paper we propose a micromechanically-based
		  model adopting a new form of Worm Like Chain free energy
		  for the copolymer chains, which takes care of the
		  insurgence of residual stretches on the basis of a rigorous
		  statistical mechanics result. Under the affinity hypothesis
		  we subsequently derive the macroscopic response of the
		  material. The obtained model has a clear physical
		  interpretation and depends on a small number of parameters,
		  which can be fitted by a simple uniaxial test. The
		  effectiveness of the theoretical results has then been
		  verified by performing cyclic tests on Monocryl®
		  monofilament sutures and showing the ability of the model
		  in predicting with high accuracy the history dependence,
		  the damage and permanent deformations in the obtained
		  response.}

		  overcomes one of the major shortcomings in constitutive
		  equations for solids admitting localization of deformation
		  at finite strains, i.e. their inability to provide
		  physically acceptable solutions to boundary value problems
		  in the post-localization range due to loss of ellipticity
		  of the governing equations. Specifically, strain-induced
		  localized deformation patterns are accounted for by adding
		  a second deformation gradient-dependent term to the
		  expression for the strain energy density. The modified
		  strain energy function leads to equilibrium equations which
		  remain always elliptic. Explicit solutions of these
		  equations can be found for certain classes of deformations.
		  They suggest not only the direction but also the width of
		  the deformation bands providing for the first time a
		  predictive unifying method for the study of pre- and

		  linearized elastic solid, when the aspect ratio is
		  sufficiently small, depending on the values of certain

		  concentration for the porous solid increases as the aspect
		  ratio (the ratio of the major axis to the minor axis)
		  decreases. By allowing the aspect ratio of the ellipse to
		  go to zero, we can obtain the state of stress and strain

  abstract	= {Wormlike micellar solutions possess complex rheology: when
		  exposed to a flow field, the wormlike micelles may
		  orientate, stretch, and break into smaller micelles.
		  Entangled wormlike micellar solutions exhibit shear banding
		  characteristics: macroscopic bands with different local
		  viscosities are organized and stacked along the velocity
		  gradient direction. We present a systematic analysis of
		  four commonly used constitutive models that can predict a
		  non-monotonic flow curve and potentially describe the
		  rheology of entangled wormlike micellar solutions with
		  shear-banding characteristics: the Johnson-Segalman, the
		  Giesekus, the thixotropic viscoelastic, and the
		  Vasquez-Cook-McKinley (VCM) models. All four constitutive
		  models contain a stress diffusion term, to account for a
		  smooth transition between the shear bands and ensure a
		  uniqueness of the numerical solution. Initially, the models
		  are fitted to shear and extensional experimental data of a
		  shear-banding wormlike micellar solution. Subsequently,
		  they are employed to solve three non-homogeneous flows: the
		  Poiseuille flow in a planar channel, the flow in a
		  cross-slot geometry, and the flow past a cylinder in a
		  straight channel. Each of these flows exposes the wormlike
		  micellar solution to different flow kinematics (shear,
		  extensional, and mixed), revealing different aspects of its
		  rheological response. The predictive capability of each
		  model is evaluated by directly comparing the numerical
		  results to previously published experimental data obtained
		  from microfluidic devices with corresponding flow
		  configurations. While all the models can describe
		  qualitatively the characteristic features observed
		  experimentally in the benchmark flows, such as plug-like
		  velocity profiles and elastic instabilities, none of them
		  yields a quantitative agreement. Based on the overall
		  performance of the models and also accounting for its
		  numerical simplicity, we conclude that the Giesekus model
		  is at present the most suitable constitutive equation for
		  simulating shear banding wormlike micellar solutions in
		  flows that exhibit both shear and extensional deformations.
		  However, the quantitative mismatch between model
		  predictions and experiments with wormlike micellar
		  solutions demand that improved constitutive models be
		  developed in future works.}

		  anisotropic damage, permanent stretch and internal
		  hysteresis. By also studying other suture materials
		  behavior we show that the predictivity properties of the
		  model can be extended also to materials with a different
		  mechanical response and thus also possibly applied for the
		  design of new, high-performance biomedical materials.}

		  Lagrangian strain and temperature fields. A major
		  difficulty in the IR-DIC is the evolution of the thermal
		  field during deformation that is unexpected in the image
		  correlation. Two solutions are proposed to tackle this
		  difficulty. The first solution is to utilize a high-pass
		  filter to eliminate the variation part of the thermal
		  signal, and the second solution is to employ an advanced
		  metric, the mutual information, as the correlation
		  criterion. Both methods are verified through a tensile test
		  performed on a notched specimen. The estimated displacement
		  and strain fields demonstrate well the desirable
		  performance of the proposed methods. Thanks to the
		  kinematic field assessment, the obtained thermal fields can
		  be described in the Lagrangian coordinate system, thus the
		  temperature evolution of the material points during
		  deformation can be followed effectively."

		  force it exerts on the whirling body by an amount depending
		  in a simple way on the spring mass; the excess can be

  abstract	= "According to the classical hypoelasticity theory, the
		  hypoelasticity tensor, i.e. the fourth order Eulerian
		  constitutive tensor, characterizing the linear relationship
		  between the stretching and an objective stress rate, is
		  dependent on the current stress and must be isotropic.
		  Although the classical hypoelasticity in this sense
		  includes as a particular case the isotropic elasticity, it
		  fails to incorporate any given type of anisotropic
		  elasticity. This implies that one can formulate the
		  isotropic elasticity as an integrable-exactly classical
		  hypoelastic relation, whereas one can in no way do the same
		  for any given type of anisotropic elasticity. A
		  generalization of classical theory is available, which
		  assumes that the material time derivative of the rotated
		  stress is dependent on the rotated Cauchy stress, the
		  rotated stretching and a Lagrangean spin, linear and of the
		  first degree in the latter two. As compared with the
		  original idea of classical hypoelasticity, perhaps the
		  just-mentioned generalization might be somewhat drastic. In
		  this article, we show that, merely replacing the isotropy
		  property of the aforementioned stress-dependent
		  hypoelasticity tensor with the invariance property of the
		  latter under an R-rotating material symmetry group R⋆G0,
		  one may establish a natural generalization of classical
		  theory, which includes all of elasticity. Here R is the
		  rotation tensor in the polar decomposition of the
		  deformation gradient and G0 any given initial material
		  symmetry group. In particular, the classical case is
		  recovered whenever the material symmetry is assumed to be
		  isotropic. With the new generalization it is demonstrated
		  that any two non-integrable hypoelastic relations based on
		  any two objective stress rates predict quite different
		  path-dependent responses in nature and hence can in no
		  sense be equivalent. Thus, the non-integrable hypoelastic
		  relations based on any given objective stress rate
		  constitute an independent constitutive class in its own
		  right which is disjoint with and hence distinguishes itself
		  from any class based on another objective stress rate. Only
		  for elasticity, equivalent hypoelastic formulations based
		  on different stress rates may be established. Moreover,
		  universal integrability conditions are derived for all
		  kinds of objective corotational stress rates and for all
		  types of material symmetry. Explicit, simple,
		  integrable-exactly hypoelastic relations based on the newly
		  discovered logarithmic stress rate are presented to
		  characterize hyperelasticity with any given type of
		  material symmetry. It is shown that, to achieve the latter
		  goal, the logarithmic stress rate is the only choice among
		  all infinitely many objective corotational stress rates.",

  abstract	= {Rubber industry plays an important part in various
		  application fields and particle-filled rubbers with
		  reinforced mechanical properties are very essential. The
		  stress softening during cyclic loading, known as the
		  Mullins effect, are evident in filled rubbers. The Mullins
		  softening can induce permanent set and anisotropy. It is
		  crucial to understand these phenomena well. In this paper,
		  we propose a new constitutive model that integrates the
		  micro-sphere model with the network alteration theory. The
		  physical mechanisms of the Mullins effect in
		  particle-filled rubbers are analyzed elaborately and
		  comprehensively to propose new directional damage equations
		  for the network alteration parameters. Both the softening
		  effects in stretched directions and the stiffening effects
		  in contracted directions are taken into account in the
		  modelling. The resulting theoretical model is then applied
		  to predict the stress softening, the residual stretch and
		  the induced anisotropy in vsrious filled rubbers. Moreover,
		  the prediction effect of the current model is compared with
		  those by applying two existing directional macromolecular
		  models. The comparisons with other model predictions and
		  with the experimental data are then analyzed intensively to
		  reveal the underlying mechanisms of the Mullins effect in
		  the different filled rubbers. The results demonstrate the
		  capability of the proposed model to quantitatively predict
		  the Mullins effect with permanent set and induced
		  anisotropy and to clearly reveal the major mechanisms of
		  the Mullins effect for various filled rubbers.}
